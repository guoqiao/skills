# Data centers in space makes no sense

Data centers in space makes no sense

SpaceX acquired xAI on Monday, forming a $1.25 trillion behemoth with the goal
of sending data centers into space. They’re not alone either: Google and a host
of startups like Lonestar, Axiom, and Nvidia-backed Starcloud are scrambling
into the field. Endless solar power, free real estate, and most importantly,
huge rockets! What more could you want?

A study from Google last year looked at the viability of doing AI in space. The
authors envision a constellation of 81 satellites flying in close proximity, and
argue that if the cost of launching stuff into low earth orbit fell to $200/kg,
it could be competitive with an equivalent ground-based data center. They
project this might happen around 2035 if SpaceX’s Starship program succeeds.

But even if we stipulate that radiation, cooling, latency, and launch costs are
all solved, other fundamental issues still make orbital data centers, at least
as SpaceX understands them, a complete fantasy. Three in particular come to
mind:

- Training and serving frontier AI at scale takes hundreds of thousands of GPUs.
xAI’s Colossus cluster reportedly has 200,000 GPUs. OpenAI has plans for
millions of them. Competing in this market would require launching hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of satellites into space. This would utterly dwarf
the roughly 15,000 satellites that are currently orbiting the earth. Satellite
deployments at this scale would dramatically increase the risk of Kessler
syndrome: a cascading explosion of debris crippling our access to space.

- Satellites can’t be upgraded at scale. Today when a new generation of AI
hardware is released, companies can start rolling them out across their data
centers immediately. In space, you have to launch a whole new fleet of a
gazillion satellites.

- Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost effective relative to
normal data centers. This means that even if, in 2035, the cost of rockets and
extremely specialized satellite hardware fall to the point where they’re
competitive with an AI server today, they will still need to be competitive with
the price of running a normal AI server in 2035, and for as long as data centers
exist. Ground-based solar panels have been getting more cost effective for
decades and show no sign of slowing down. With every improvement in normal
energy production, data centers in space make less and less sense.

So if this is clearly nonsense, why are serious companies and investors piling
into it? At least in the case of SpaceX, the company is targeting an IPO this
year and has a huge incentive to raise excitement ahead of that. xAI is burning
mountains of cash every day and needs regular top-ups to keep the lights on.
Investors themselves can be perfectly rational while buying into a project they
(or at least their analysts) know isn’t feasible. They only need an expectation
of profiting by selling to the next guy. Since the timelines to actually putting
meaningful compute in space are so long, there’s plenty of time for companies
and investors to ride this wave before coming back down to earth.

## Comments

Bender: AI data-centers use upwards of 100MW.  The biggest solar panels in space
could produce around 240KW.   When they speak of AI data-centers in space what
do they actually mean in realistic non theoretical terms and where are the
materials for this coming from?  If the AI data-center used only 10MW then each
could have two redundant SMR's assuming the cooling challenges have been worked
out but then we could have nuclear reactor disposal and collision issues.

    shetaye: I assume the idea is to have the entire constellation be the data
    center in question. Laser back haul transceiver bandwidth is in the same order
    of magnitude of rack-to-rack bandwidths [1][2]. I could see each sat being a
    rack and the entire mesh being a cluster.  [1]
    https://hackaday.com/2024/02/05/starlinks-inter-satellite-la... (and this is two
    years ago!) [2] https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-accelerated-networking-re...

        reactordev: This is how Starlink works however, you would need orders of
        magnitude more compute than those router pucks. Orders of magnitude more power
        needs unless you combined a nuclear reactor to it. It’s just such a fever dream
        at this stage that he’s really doing it to muddy accounting and consolidate
        debts from Grok failures.

        kuschku: For AI training, latency is one of the limiting factors, which needs to
        be kept in the nanoseconds. And a light-nanosecond is famously almost exactly 1
        foot.  That's why Lumen/Starcloud's designs all assume it'll be a space station
        with all containers connected to one central networking spine.

    vitaflo: This is the thing I don’t get. Everyone talking about the “how” but
    nobody talking about the “why”?  It makes literally no sense.

        Bender: The only thing that keeps bouncing around in my thick skull is something
        "data-center sized" whatever that means to them could hold some interesting
        objects.  2 Peta Watt laser, Rods from God, Tactical nukes, Miniature Rail-gun
        to quickly eradicate other satellites, Off-Planet archives of stuff, Doomsday
        clusters of brainwave transmitters to shut off all the humans or force everyone
        to defecate at once.  Those are just some guesses.  Some of those could also
        explain the "why" for SpaceX Falcon Heavy and it's future iterations.   It can
        carry 63,800 kg (140,660 lbs) to Low Earth Orbit and that load capacity will
        only increase with future versions.

        whynotmaybe: Snake oil, like bitcoin.  A lot of people will invest in this
        because "it's the future" and a few will make a lot of money on that.

        alansammarone: Because people have to compete just to have sand doing math for
        us? The why is that it's high time we stop worrying about how much compute we
        have. Certainly filling all solid planets in the solar system with computers is
        not nearly enough computation as we want (I'm not even talking about AI
        specifically).

Starman_Jones: Very confused by this plan. Data centers on Earth are struggling
with how to get rid of waste heat. It's really, really hard to get rid of waste
heat in space. That seems to be about the worst possible place to put a data
center.

    palmotea: That's not Elon's problem. He's an ideas guy. Data centers in space is
    definitely an idea.

        Mordisquitos: Indeed. I would go so far as to assert that, of all the ideas that
        have ever been proposed in the history of humanity, data centres in space is
        most certainly one of them.

            emchammer: Just ask this scientician.

                AlexandrB: Uhhhh

                    fuzzfactor: >data centres in space is most certainly one of them.  >Uhhhh
                    Thanks, I wouldn't have noticed how wrong that was otherwise ;)  It's most
                    certainly two of them.

        mhh__: Yeah he only micromanages (look at his old blog) every detail he has time
        for at an extremely successful aerospace engineering company, just an ideas guy.

            youarentrightjr: > Yeah he only micromanages (look at his old blog) every detail
            he has time for at an extremely successful aerospace engineering company, just
            an ideas guy.  Have you ever spoken to someone who works at SpaceX? I have
            multiple friends in the industry, who have taken a trip through the company.
            The overwhelming consensus is that - in meetings, you nod along and tell Elon
            "great idea". Immediately after you get back to real engineering and design
            things such that they make sense.  The folks working there are under no delusion
            that he has any business being involved in rocket science, it's fascinating that
            the general public doesn't see it that way.

                ta988: Or you are actively trying to have the meetings when you are sure he
                cannot be present because he keeps derailing them.

                mhh__: Why are they doing any better than any other firm then? Why has Tesla
                been successful? Why is xAI pretty similar in terms of approach? My idea has
                less variables than yours. It also doesn't fly with his tendency to fire people.

                    lokar: Shedding the very slow process of “legacy” defense/aerospace companies,
                    taking more risks, moving faster, accepting some setbacks etc does not mean you
                    need to go full Musk.  There is a middle ground.

                    CamperBob2: The same reason why Microsoft was able to kick everybody else out of
                    the PC operating system and office software sectors: everybody else was even
                    less competent.

                        mhh__: Bill Gates was also pretty good

                            fuzzfactor: More capable at programming or kicking people out of contention?

                        robocat: I always felt that Microsoft's winning move was to be consistently
                        mediocre. They just waited until competitors screwed up. Now they're following
                        in IBMs or Intel's footsteps - concentrating everything on the enterprise market
                        and slowly dying.

                    youarentrightjr: > Why are they doing any better than any other firm then?  Any
                    other firm, you mean like the bloated and bureaucratic NASA/JPL/defense
                    contractor madhouse? That's not much competition.  > Why has Tesla been
                    successful? Why is xAI pretty similar in terms of approach?  My idea has less
                    variables than yours. It also doesn't fly with his tendency to fire people.
                    Your "idea" (statement) is that his companies are successful due to his
                    micromanagement. In reality, they're successful in spite of it. Like all
                    impactful engineering institutions, there are incredibly talented people working
                    at the "bottom" levels of these companies that hold the whole thing together.
                    There's a good bit of irony here in your thought that he'd fire people that
                    didn't agree with him or disobeyed him. From what I've heard, he lacks the
                    technical rigor to even understand how what was implemented differs from his
                    totally awesome and cool, off the cuff, reality adjacent ideas.  The myth of the
                    supergenius CEO has real potential to influence investors, beyond that, the hard
                    engineering is up to the engineers. Period. SpaceX wouldn't have gotten past
                    o-ring selection with Elon at the engineering helm.

                        robocat: > NASA/JPL/defense contractor  Perhaps learn to look around the world.
                        Europe has nothing, China is working on copying. New Zealand has RocketLab but
                        looks like they've sold out to the states and is only for small payloads yet.

                            youarentrightjr: > Perhaps learn to look around the world. Europe has nothing,
                            China is working on copying. New Zealand has RocketLab but looks like they've
                            sold out to the states and is only for small payloads yet.  And which of those
                            is also an American institution, with American educated employees and American
                            cultural values, operating in an American legal and business framework?
                            Pretending NZ is a relevant comparison point is laughable. I bet SpaceX is also
                            doing better than the 5th grade STEM class down the street!  Russia would've
                            been a much better comparison given the history of the world we live in, but
                            still not apples to apples.

                    ambicapter: Have you ever worked at a company? Was how profitable the company
                    was directly related to how high-functioning it was? Not in my experience.

                        fuzzfactor: This is so true.  When you boil it down though, sometimes more than
                        one company is built using almost the same exact mold, and the only major
                        difference between them is the idea that the business plan is bult around.  More
                        profitable ideas are good to have.  High-functioning or not.

                    oblio: > Why has Tesla been successful?  Survivor bias. He's had how many failed
                    businesses? 10? Probably more.

                lokar: I have heard similar things

                gordian-mind: Any cool kid in uni has had the same views as you do for ten
                years.  What do you and them know that the countless extremely successful
                engineers who actually worked with Elon do not?  https://erik-
                engheim.medium.com/is-elon-musk-just-a-sales-gu...

                    youarentrightjr: > What do you and them know that the countless extremely
                    successful engineers who actually worked with Elon do not?  Did you read my
                    comment?  "I have multiple friends in the industry, who have taken a trip
                    through the company."  I am literally referring to extremely successful
                    engineers who have worked directly with Elon.  I'm going to need more than a
                    puff piece on some random Elon stan's medium page to outweigh what I've heard
                    from my friends.

    Keyframe: Very confused by this plan.  How about now?
    https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3ex92557jo

        general1465: Well this explains why, but does not answer how to get rid of
        excessive heat in space.

            reactordev: It’s a vacuum

                floren: Vacuum being so famous for not conducting heat that we use it to keep
                our coffee hot

                    reactordev: which is why the whole idea of data centers in space is ridiculous.

                        floren: I'm glad to realize we're in violent agreement, I thought you were
                        implying cooling would be easy due to the vacuum!

                            reactordev: It can be solved with radiator fins and cold plates but yeah, it’s
                            not an easy task.

            avmich: What kind of the problem you're talking about compared to existing
            satellites? That is, all existing satellites generate power, and need to
            dissipate that power, and most of it goes to waste heat, and the satellites
            somehow do that successfully - what is the specific problem you're talking
            about, which can't be solved by the same means?

                nilamo: Are there many of those current satellites running gpus and actually
                generating lots of heat?

                    avmich: Principally speaking, as much energy as satellite receives from solar
                    panels it needs to send away - and often a lot of it is in the form of heat. So,
                    the question is, how much energy is received in the first place. We currently
                    have some quarter of megawatt of solar panels of ISS, so in principal - in
                    principal - we know how to do this kind of scale per satellite. In practice we
                    perhaps will have more smaller satellites which together aggregate the compute
                    to the necessary lever and power to the corresponding level.

                        vel0city: > We currently have some quarter of megawatt of solar panels of ISS
                        It's average outbut is like half of that though. So something the size of the
                        space station, a massive thing which is largely solar panels and radiators, can
                        do like 120kW sustained. Like 1-2 racks of GPUs, assuming you used the entire
                        power budget on GPUs.  And we're going to build and launch millions of these.

                jasonwatkinspdx: Even the buses for giant communications satellites are still at
                the single digit kilowatt scale. The current state of the art in AI datacenters
                is 500+ kw per rack.  So you're talking about an entirely different scale of
                power and needed cooling.

                idontwantthis: The ISS's radiators weigh thousands of kilograms to radiate
                around 70 KW. He's talking about building data centers in space in the GW range.
                Assuming he built this in LEO (which doesn't make sense because of atmospheric
                drag), and the highest estimates for what starship could one day deliver to LEO
                (200 metric tons), and only 1 metric ton of radiators per 100KW, that's 50
                launches just to carry up the radiators.

                verytrivial: The numbers matter. The thermal budget a satellite is an tightly
                controlled thing. Large modern ones are in the order of a few to a couple of 10s
                of kilowatts, so something like a few to several low 10s of modern GPU compute
                power.  Even with thousands of yet to be designed or launched satellites, it's
                going to have trouble competing with even a single current DC, plus it is in
                SAPCE for some reason, so everything is more expensive for lots of reasons.

                    avmich: > it's going to have trouble competing with even a single current DC
                    This looks like a valid argument to me, yes. Elon mentioned 1,000,000 satellites
                    - I'm thinking about 3rd version of Starlink as a typical example, 2 tons, 60
                    satellites per Starship launch, 16,000 Starship launches for the constellation,
                    comparing with 160 launches per year of today's Falcon 9...  The argument about
                    problems of dissipating heat still stands - I don't see a valid counterargument
                    here. Also "SAPCE" problem looks different from the point of view of this
                    project - https://www.50dollarsat.info/ . Basically, out launch costs go way
                    down, and quality of electronics and related tech today on Earth is high enough
                    to work on LEO.

                protocolture: I mean you have this around the wrong way.  The reason we dont
                have a lot of compute in space, is because of the heat issue. We could have
                greater routing density on communication satellites, if we could dissipate more
                heat. If Starlink had solved this issue they would have like triple the capacity
                and could just drop everything back to the US (like their fans think they do)
                rather than trying to minimise the number of satellites traffic passes through
                before exiting back to a ground station usually in the same country as the
                source. In fact, conspiratorially, I think thats the problem he wants to solve.
                Because wet dreams of an unhindered, unregulated, space internet are completely
                unanswered in the engineering of Starlink.  I have actually argued this from the
                other side, and I reckon space data centres are sort of feasible in a thought
                experimental sense. I think its a solvable problem eventually. But heat is the
                major limiting factor and back of the napkin math stinks tbh.  IIRC the
                size/weight of the satellite is going to get geometrically larger as you
                increase the compute size due to the size of the required cooling system. Then
                we get into a big argument about how you bring the heat from the component to
                the cooling system. I think oil, but its heavy again, and several space
                engineering types want to slap me in the face for suggesting it. Some rube
                goldberg copper heatpipe network through atmosphere system seems to be
                preferred.  I feel like, best case, its a Tesla situation, he clears the
                legislative roadblocks and solves some critical engineering problem by throwing
                money at it, and then other, better people step in to actually do it. Also
                triple the time he says it will take to solve the problem.  And then,
                ultimately, as parts fail theres diminishing returns on the satellite. And you
                dont even get to take the old hardware to the secondary market, it gets dropped
                in the ocean or burnt up on reentry.

    Spooky23: It’s a distraction as they suck out as much value from Tesla as
    possible before the music stops and they go bust. There are a few really big
    IPOs this year including SpaceX, which will likely trigger significant market
    volatility.

        93po: yes, tesla, famously the worst performing car manufacturer with the worst
        profit margins, is definitely going bust any day now

            Spooky23: Clearly 200 forward P/E and three consecutive quarters of missed
            earning is a sign of profitability.  It's a stock worth $50-60 with generous
            valuation. The premium is the Elon bullshit and grift. That isn't gonna last
            forever.

            according to figures from Kelley Blue Book's annual electric vehicle (EV) sales
            reports.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-sales-elon-mus...  > A
            federal safety report shows that Tesla is recalling 63,619 of its futuristic
            pickups, and this seems to be the total number of Cybertrucks built since the
            first one was delivered at the end of 2023.
            https://www.arenaev.com/teslas_latest_recall_reveals_real_cy...  > Musk said
            that it's time to put the Model S and Model X vehicles to rest. Now it's not
            that huge of a change, given that 97% of Tesla's sales consist of Model 3 and
            Model Y cars, but the Model S is still the original car delivered by Tesla.
            https://www.arenaev.com/tesla_discontinues_the_model_s_and_m...  > The financial
            report paints a grim picture for the company. Tesla's total profit for 2025 was
            €3.24 billion. That is a lot of money, whichever way you look at it, but it is
            actually 46 percent less than what the company made in 2024. The profit margin,
            which is the percentage of money the company keeps after paying expenses, fell
            to just 4.9 percent. In 2022, that number sat at 23.8 percent.  > One of the
            most interesting parts of the financial report is how Tesla made its money. A
            large chunk of its profit did not come from selling EVs to people. Instead, it
            came from selling "regulatory credits" to other car companies that need help
            meeting pollution rules. These credits brought in €2 billion.  > That means 52
            percent of Tesla's entire profit for the year came from these credits, not from
            selling vehicles. If Tesla did not have those credits, the financial results
            would look much worse. And the problem the company is facing? Those credits are
            gone; they won't be part of Tesla's business model this year since they were
            cancelled by the current administration.
            https://www.arenaev.com/tesla_profits_drop_as_automaker_star...  Tesla is
            betting on long shots like humanoid robots and self driving taxis everywhere.
            There are other desperation moves like merging Tesla (profitable) with SpaceX (I
            think it's also profitable? but most of its business is governments: risky
            markets) and xAI (most likely wildly unprofitable, just like Twitter).

    general1465: Well the issue is that a lot of people believe that space is cold.
    If you will ask Google/Gemini what is a temperature of space, it will tell you:
    The average temperature of deep space is approximately -270.45°C or 2.73
    Kelvin), which is just above absolute zero. This baseline temperature is set by
    the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiatio...  Which is absolute nonsense,
    because vacuum has no temperature.

        ZeroGravitas: I saw a news personality say that space is cold and that solves a
        big problem with datacenters as justification for why it made sense.

            iancmceachern: Space is cold because there isn't anything there.  There is also
            no matter to wick the heat away.

        aqme28: Well it isn't a perfect vacuum and it does have a temperature. But
        temperature is only a part of the story, just like how you go hypothermic a lot
        faster in 50 degree water than in 50 degree air.

        emkoemko: but if you did use thermometer in space it would eventual read 2.73
        kelvin right? so whats the issue? and also for a space based server it would
        have to deal with the energy coming from the sun

            iancmceachern: There is no matter.  It's cold there because there isn't anything
            there.  So there is nothing to conduct or convect the heat away.  It's like a
            giant vacuum insulated  thermos.  Is putting data centers in thermos' a good
            idea?

                emkoemko: i am not saying its a good idea, just wondering because you say space
                has no temperature, but that makes no sense for the reason CMB radiation would
                prevent you from having 0 k right? and in fact how would you even measure it?
                wouldn't the measuring device its self have way more then 0K?  plus you would
                have to insulate the servers from the sun...then have radiators like the ISS...
                i think its just way easier to run a server on the ground

                    ambicapter: Why did you say "eventually" in your original post? That answers
                    your question.

                    iancmceachern: It's a rate problem

            legohead: what thermometer would you use to measure the temperature of space?

                iancmceachern: Thermocouples

            iancmceachern: Yes and no.  If you had a thermometer that had no heat generation
            then yes.  If you have a resistor or other heat generating circuit then you need
            to have the needed surface area to radiate the heat away.  If you don't, it will
            heat up.  It's a rate problem.

        guluarte: I'm not a scientist but i am also sure it will be fucking hard to
        dissipate heat in a vacuum

        jfengel: Vacuum does have a temperature; it has a blackbody temperature.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation  It has nothing to do with
        the movements of atoms, but just with the spectrum of photons moving through it.
        It means that eventually, any object left in space will reach that temperature.
        But it will not necessarily do it quickly, which is what you need if you're
        trying to cool something that is emitting heat.

        drowsspa: That's not how it works. Two bodies are in thermal equilibrium if
        there's no heat transfer between them: that's the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
        If you're colder than 2.73K in deep space, you will absorb the heat from the
        Cosmic Microwave Background. If you're hotter, you will irradiate heat away. So
        it does have a temperature.

            OscarCunningham: Does this mean that if Earth stays a fixed distance from the
            sun then its equilibrium temperature is fixed? I remember people saying things
            like that the albedo of the ice caps affected the Earth's temperature.

    jillesvangurp: You are confusing engineering challenges with show stoppers.
    Cooling in space is a well studied problem with a few possible solutions. They
    all boil down to needing a lot of mass to radiate heat out to the universe and
    ways to conduct heat. We've been doing that at small scale for decades. SpaceX
    is already operating a fleet of many thousands of satellites that they built and
    engineered. They'd be well familiar with this challenge.  Once you have
    solutions, it turns into a cost problem. And if that cost is too high (for
    whatever arbitrary threshold you use for that) it becomes an optimization
    problem.  This whole thread reads like a lot of "but ... but ... but ...". It
    all boils down to people assuming things about what is too much or too hard. And
    it's all meaningless unless you actually bother to articulate those assumptions.
    What exactly is too hard here? What would it take to address those issues? What
    would the cost be? Put some numbers on it. There are also all sorts of
    assumptions about what is valuable and what isn't. You can't say something is
    too hard or too costly without making assertions about what is worth paying for
    and what isn't.  The answers are going to be boring. We need X amounts of giga
    tons launched to orbit at Y amount of dollars. OK great. What happens if launch
    cost drops by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude? What happens if the amount of mass
    needed drops because of some engineering innovation? Massively dropping launch
    cost is roughly what SpaceX is proposing to do with Star Ship. Is it still "too
    hard"? You can't have that debate until you put numbers on your assertions.
    There's a bit of back of the envelope math involved here but we're roughly
    talking about a million satellites. In the order of ~2.5 million tonnes of mass
    (at 2.5 ton per satellite). Tens of thousands of Star Ship launches basically.
    It's definitely a big project. We're talking about 1-2 order magnitude increase
    of the scale of operations for SpaceX going from lower hundreds to thousands of
    launches per year spread over maybe 10-15 years to work up to a million
    satellites.  I'm more worried about what all that mass is going to do when it
    burns up in the atmosphere / drops in the oceans. At that scale it's no longer
    just a drop in the ocean.

        zarzavat: Nobody is saying that building a data center in space is impossible.
        It's merely expensive.  Who is going to pay the money to rent capacity in space
        when they could rent the same capacity on Earth for a fraction of the cost?

        Starman_Jones: You make some good points, but when there are cheaper
        alternatives, engineering problems ARE showstoppers, and for good reason! If
        Musk announced that he wanted to build a datacenter inside an active volcano, my
        response would be pretty much the same - "Why?"

izzydata: How about we just make a giant heatsink that reaches into space
instead. Then we can cool the whole planet. Coming up with crazy ideas is cheap,
but the logistics are obviously impractical.

    0x53: Look into radiative cooling. Basically this, but more practical. Several
    companies working on it: https://www.skycoolsystems.com/

        grim_io: I don't quite believe this.  Is it really better than just using solar
        panels to run a heat pump?

            pidge: > Our core innovation is a radiative cooling material that we’ve combined
            with a panel system to improve the efficiency of any vapor-compression based
            cooling system  A heat pump is a “ vapor-compression based cooling system” so
            that tech is an addition-to not an instead-of.  Whether it’s better probably
            depends on how expensive the additional efficiency is in practice.  > SkyCool’s
            Panels save 2x – 3x as much energy as a solar panel generates given the same
            area.  So if you’re area constrained maybe.

                grim_io: That's very hard to believe. Radiative cooling is really bad compared
                to any kind of fan in front of aluminum fins.  Air itself is an isolator, there
                is a reason you need to shove in fresh air to take on more energy from the heat
                source.

        morshu9001: This looks like it depends on the outside air to cool the coolant.
        "Radiative" can mean that too, not just IR radiation.

    hahahahhaah: We had one. It was that sulphur used in shipping fuel.

RobotToaster: It possibly makes sense if you're preparing for war, harder to
hit, harder to physically break into, beyond the range of nuclear EMP, and
accessible from anywhere on earth.

    Mountain_Skies: Any country capable of producing nuclear warheads will also be
    able to toss up enough BBs and other small objects into LEO to wipe out most of
    Starlink and anything else in LEO. At least on Earth data centers in theory can
    be hidden and physically hardened. In orbit, even a crude rocket able to reach
    that plane can become a weapon of mass satellite destruction. Even if those
    orbits clear out in four or five years, by then whatever ugliness is going on
    down on the surface of Earth will likely have resolved one way or the other.
    Starlink is a great military asset for a superpower pushing around smaller
    states in ways that aren't an existential threat to them. In a real conflict,
    it's a fragile target beyond the strike capacities of much of the developing
    world but easily destroyed by any moderate level industrial nation.

        philipkglass: Any country capable of producing nuclear warheads will also be
        able to toss up enough BBs and other small objects into LEO to wipe out most of
        Starlink and anything else in LEO.  South Africa built nuclear weapons in the
        1980s:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_and_weapons_of_ma...  But it
        never had an orbital launch capability.  Pakistan doesn't have a domestic
        orbital launch capability but it does have nuclear weapons.  Surprisingly, the
        United Kingdom doesn't have a domestic orbital launch capability at present
        though it has had ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons for many decades.  At
        present, I would say that building a basic implosion-assembled atomic bomb is
        easier than building a rocket system that reach low Earth orbit. It's a lot
        easier to build a bomb now than it was in the 1940s. The main thing that
        prevents wider nuclear weapon proliferation is treaties and inspections, not
        inherent technical difficulties.

            blibble: presumably the UK could figure out how to remove the top of a trident
            missile and replace it with a load of ball bearings

                mr_toad: Tridents can reach mach 19.  Orbital velocity is more like mach 100.
                Not that the UK manufactures trident missiles anyway.

                    blibble: if only you could put some sort of explosive charge on the top

                    eeL3bo1mohn7pee: 27720km/h orbital velocity is Mach 22.4 at a sea level speed of
                    sound

                    adastra22: Orbital velocity is nowhere near mach 100.

                    kuschku: You don't need orbital velocity to blow satellites away. Just do a
                    well-timed suborbital launch against the satellite's orbit, and the satellite
                    will provide most of the kinetic energy.

            zajio1am: You do not need orbital capability to hit an orbital target. Just
            suborbital missile that reaches target's orbital altitude.

        proggy: Satellites. Are. Fragile. People really don’t seem to intuitively
        understand this. Earth based assets are orders of magnitude more difficult to
        attack simply by virtue of being able to be placed inside of fortified
        structures anchored to, or inside of, the ground. The cost to deploy hardened
        buildings at scale is peanuts compared to orbiting constellations.

        reactordev: They also fail to realize how devastating an attack a BB canister
        grenade would be in LEO. Nothing would stay in orbit. Eventually everything
        would collide and come down.

            bethekidyouwant: No?

            IcyWindows: LEO is big, really big.  Even at the smaller radius of ground level,
            large volcanos, forest fires, etc. Don't affect the whole earth.

        nvader: Isn't the eventual plan to park these data centers out by the Lagrange
        points?

    general1465: You don't need EMP for that. Few ASAT missiles will start the
    avalanche and turn orbits around Earth into shooting range. Good luck talking to
    your satellites with shredded antennas and solar panels.

    vulcan01: > harder to hit  press x to doubt  > on 21 February 2008, the US Navy
    destroyed USA-193 in Operation Burnt Frost, using a ship-fired RIM-161 Standard
    Missile 3 about 247 km (153 mi) above the Pacific Ocean.

shishcat: how much latency would a minecraft server in space have?

    wmf: With live migration it could be quite low, like 10 ms.

sheepscreek: What’s there not to like? Superconductors. Free electricity. No
cooling necessary.  Put those three together and maybe it’s possible to push
physics to its limits. Faster networking, maybe 4x-5x capacity per unit compared
to earth. Servicing is a pain, might be cheaper to just replace the hardware
when a node goes bad.  But it mainly makes sense to those who have the
capability and can do it cheaply (compared to the rest). There’s only one
company that I can think of and that is SpaceX. They are closing in on (or
passed) 8,000 satellites. Vertical integration means their cost-base will always
be less than any competitor.

    DougN7: Why is there no cooling necessary?

        sheepscreek: Space is cold - 4 K. Superconductors.

            grim_io: Repeating the word "superconductor" does not convince anyone of
            anything.

                sheepscreek: I don’t care about convincing anyone. A question was asked and I
                answered the best I could with the time I had at hand.  Also read by comment
                above that discusses WHY superconductors could be the key to cooler electronics
                in space.

            SideburnsOfDoom: Space is not cold. Space is not hot either. Temperature is a
            property of matter. Empty space does not have a temperature.  It is also a
            perfect insulator for conduction and convection, and as for radiation: it's a
            problem because of the sun heating up objects via its radiation.  This is the
            basics, I'm not an expert. But I don't think that you have anything useful at
            all to say here.

    pgalvin: Do you mean to suggest that computer hardware does not need to be
    cooled when it is in space? Or that it is trivial and easier to do this in space
    compared to on Earth? I don’t understand either claim, if so.

        sheepscreek: Superconductors. Average temperature in space is around 4 K.

            cyberax: Even assuming that this la-la-land idea has merit, the equilibrium
            temperature at the Earth's orbit is 250 Kelvin (around -20C). The space around
            the Earth is _hot_.

                sheepscreek: There are people literally working on accomplishing this. I don’t
                understand what’s with the arrogance and skepticism.  Edit: Not trying to single
                out the above commenter, just the general “air” around this in all the comments.
                I honestly believed folks on HN are generally more open minded. There’s a
                trillion dollar merger happening the sole basis of which is the topic of this
                article. One of those companies put 6-8,000 satellites to space on its own dime.
                It’s not a stretch, had they put 5 GPUs in each of those satellites, they would
                have had a 40,000 GPU datacenter in space.

                    cyberax: > There are people literally working on accomplishing this.  They're
                    reinventing physics? Wow! I guess they'll just use Grok AI to fake the launch
                    videos. Should be good enough for the MVP.  For the superconductivity idea to
                    work, the entire datacenter needs to be shielded both from sunlight and
                    earthlight. This means a GINORMOUS sun shield to provide the required shadow.
                    But wait, the datacenter will orbit the Earth, so it also will need to rotate
                    constantly to keep itself in the shadow! Good luck with station-keeping.
                    There's a reason the Webb Telescope (which is kept at a balmy 50K) had to be
                    moved to a Sun-Earth Lagrange point. Or why previous infrared telescopes used
                    slowly evaporating liquid helium for cooling.  >  I don’t understand what’s with
                    the arrogance and skepticism.  Because it's a fundamentally stupid idea. Stupid
                    ideas should be laughed out.  I'm not talking about "stupid because it's hard to
                    do" but "stupid because of fundamental physical limitations".

                    thinkcontext: The problem you are encountering is how you are discussing
                    superconductors.  If you want to convince people that they are relevant you
                    should explain how they would be used.  You haven't done that at all, you just
                    keep repeating "superconductors".  And it would be helpful if you showed some
                    uses of superconductors in space similar to what you propose and not some vague
                    proposal for research that would take decades to realize.  I'm not familiar with
                    any use of them relevant to this application and I take the other people
                    responding to you are not either.

            emkoemko: you do know about the Sun? Earth? and the Moon? where would you get
            this 4 kelvin?

        sfink: The computer hardware only needs to run enough AI compute to be smart
        enough to convince Musk that it's working. It should be fine.

    jasonpeacock: > No cooling necessary.  This is false, it's hard to cool things
    in space. Space (vacuum) is a very good insulator.  3 are ways to cool things
    (lose energy):    - Conduction   - Convection   - Radiation  In space, only
    radiation works, and it's the least efficient of those 3 options.

        sheepscreek: Superconductors.

            IshKebab: Magnets.  (We're just saying random physics things right?)

                emkoemko: i think so, next is Quantum right?

                whh: Could we use a constant stream of micro-asteroids as a heatsink?

                sheepscreek: No, just you. Superconductors don’t get hot. There is 0 resistance
                in superconducting mediums. Theoretically you could manufacture a lot of the
                electricity conducting medium out of a superconductor. Even the cheapest kind
                will superconduct in space (because it’s so cold).  Radiation may be sufficient
                for the little heat that does get produced.

                    ben_w: If/when we get high-performance superconducting computers, we wouldn't
                    need to put the computers in space in the first place.

                    sfink: Right. You build your computers out of superconductors, and they don't
                    get hot.  Sadly, they also don't compute.  > Even the cheapest kind will
                    superconduct in space (because it’s so cold).  Is this a drinking game? Take a
                    drink whenever someone claims that heat is not a problem because space is cold?
                    Because I'm going to have alcohol poisoning soon.  Let's see how cold you feel
                    when you leave the Earth's shadow and the sun hits you.

                    haddonist: You've invented a room-temperature superconducting material? No?
                    Didn't think so.  Currently available superconductors still need liquid nitrogen
                    cooling, meaning they're not feasible for in-orbit installations.

                    shagie: > Even the cheapest kind will superconduct in space (because it’s so
                    cold).  Space is not cold or hot - it isn't.  It's a vacuum.  Vacuum has no
                    temperature, but objects in space reach temperatures set by radiative balance
                    with their environment.  This makes it difficult to get rid of heat.  On earth
                    heat can be dumped through phase change and discharged (evaporation), or
                    convection or any number of other ways.  In space the only way to get rid of
                    heat is to radiate it away.  Superconductors don't have any resistance - and so
                    heating from resistance isn't present.  However, no super conducting computers
                    have been created.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_computing  And
                    yes, it is really impressive - but we're also talking about one chip in liquid
                    helium on earth.  One can speculate about the "what if we had..." but we don't.
                    If you want to make up technologies I would suggest becoming a speculative
                    fiction author.  Heating of the spacecraft would get it on the warm side.
                    https://www.amu.apus.edu/area-of-study/science/resources/why...  > The same
                    variations in temperature are observed in closer orbit around the Earth, such as
                    at the altitudes that the International Space Station (ISS) occupies.
                    Temperatures at the ISS range between 250° F in direct sunlight and -250° F in
                    opposition to the Sun.  > You might be surprised to learn that the average
                    temperature outside the ISS is a mild 50° F or so. This average temperature is
                    above the halfway point between the two temperature extremes because objects in
                    orbit obviously spend more time in partial sunlight exposure than in complete
                    opposition to the Sun.  > The wild fluctuations of 500° F around the ISS are due
                    to the fact that there is no insulation in space to regulate temperature
                    changes. By contrast, temperatures on Earth’s surface don’t fluctuate more than
                    a few degrees between day and night. Fortunately, we have an atmosphere and an
                    ozone layer to insulate the Earth, protect it from the Sun’s most powerful
                    radiation and maintain relatively consistent temperatures.  If you want solar
                    power, you've got to deal with the 250 °F (121 °C).  This is far beyond the
                    specification for super conducting materials.  For that matter, even -250 °F
                    (-156 °C = 116 K) is much warmer than the super conducting chip range of 10 K.
                    Furthermore, the cryogenic material boils off in space quite significantly (I
                    would suggest reading
                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_propellant_depot#LEO_d... or
                    https://spacexstock.com/orbital-refueling-bottlenecks-what-i... "Even minor heat
                    exposure can cause fuel to boil off, increasing tank pressure and leading to
                    fuel loss. Currently, the technology for keeping cryogenic fuels stable in space
                    is limited to about 14 hours.") You are going to have significant problems
                    trying to keep things at super conducting temperatures for a day, much less a
                    month or a year.  Even assuming that you can make a computer capable of doing AI
                    training using super computers this decade (or even the next) ... zero
                    resistance in the wire is not zero power consumption.  That power consumption is
                    again heat.  ---  > Theoretically you could manufacture a lot of the electricity
                    conducting medium out of a superconductor.  Theoretically you can do whatever
                    you want and run it on nuclear fusion.  Practically, the technologies that you
                    are describing are not things that are viable on earth, much less to try to ship
                    a ton of liquid helium into space (that's even harder than shipping a ton of
                    liquid hydrogen - especially since harvesting it is non-trivial).  ---
                    Computing creates heat.  Maxwell's demon taught us that doing 1 & 1 and getting
                    one creates heat.  Every bit of computation creates heat - superconductor or no.
                    This is an inescapable fact of classical computation.  "Ahh," you say " - but
                    you can do quantum computation"... and yes, it may work... and if you can get a
                    quantum computer with a kilobit of qbits into space, I will be very impressed.
                    ---  One of the things that damages superconductors is radiation.  On earth
                    we've got a nice atmosphere blocking the worst of it.  Chips in space tend to be
                    radiation hardened.  The JWST is using a BAE RAD750.  The 750 should be
                    something that rings a bell in the mind of people... its a PPC 750 - the type in
                    a Macintosh G3... running between 110 and 200 Mhz (that is not a typo, it is not
                    Ghz but Mhz).  High temperature super conductors (we're not dealing with the 10
                    kelvin but rather about 80 kelvin (still colder than -250 °F) are very sensitive
                    to damage to their lattice.  As they accumulate damage they become less
                    superconductive and that causes problems when you've got a resistor heating up
                    in the cryogenic computer.  ---  Your descriptions of the technology for
                    superconducting computers is in the lab, at best decades from being something
                    resembling science fact (much less a fact that you can lift into space).

        SideburnsOfDoom: > In space, only radiation works  it's worse, incoming
        radiation also works to heat up objects that are in sunlight and in space. And
        you want to be in sunlight for the solar panels.  This is why surface of the
        moon is at temperatures of -120C when it's night and +120C when it's day there.
        And the sun's radiation also flips bits.  Yes, it's technically possible to work
        around all of these. There are existing designs for radiators in the shade of
        the solar panels. Radiation shielding and/or resistant hardware. It's just not
        even close to economic at datacentre scale.

    tenuousemphasis: Your exuberance for this topic is only matched by your lack of
    understanding about it.

    browningstreet: Do you know the lifespan of those satellites? Do you know how
    many of those fall out (sorry, de-orbited) of space every year?  Do you know the
    cost of sending up a payload of them?  Do you know how much $$ you need to
    extract from those payloads to make the cost of sending them up make sense?  Do
    you know how much they've lied about Starlink revenue and subscription counts?

antonymoose: To Steelman the topic, Musk’s whole alleged mission is to make
humans a multi-planet species that can survive an earth killing event.  To that
end, a small data center space isn’t about unit-economics, it’s a bigger
mission. So the question we should consider is what can we put into space the
further that mission. Can we put a meaningful sum of human knowledge out there
for preservation? It sounds like “yes,” even if we can’t train ChatGPT models
out there yet.

    redwood: Sure but you could do that with a simple disc in space

        mongol: Actually, the data centers can be the discs. As long as the data centers
        can crunch on, we don't need to stay alive here on earth

    awakeasleep: When I was a kid, I had to go to CCD, a religious after school
    program for Catholics.  The whole time I was there it was a mental game of
    trying to steel man the contradictory or incoherent stuff, using my brain power
    to try and rewrite things to make sense.  After some years, I woke up and
    realized that’s what I was doing, and even if I could do it in my mind, that
    didn’t make the source material rational.  Heres hoping you have a similar
    moment.

        antonymoose: > Heres hoping you have a similar moment.  I do not politically
        align with Musk. I’ve always thought Tesla was important in popularizing
        electric cars while being a low-quality built product with repair and supply
        chain issues. I think The Boring Company is a joke. Twitter was a power-grab.  I
        also think SpaceX is societally beneficial, a good means to shake-up a stagnant
        industry and a humanity-wide area of interest.  If you think I’m a member of a
        religious cult, I respectfully suggest you evaluate what led You to believe that
        itself.

            awakeasleep: I completely failed to convey my point. It’s not about any of your
            beliefs.  The point is that you have been handed a pile of incoherent hog wash,
            and you are using all the powers at your command to rearrange it into a coherent
            narrative. It’s like a mental game that some of us cannot help but play.  The
            point is you have to realize you are playing a game, in your head, and even if
            you can make a beautiful pattern out of the noise, it was still just noise.
            Where there is actual meaning in life, its kind of obvious, you dont have to
            rewrite so much to find it.

                handedness: > ...you are using all the powers at your command to rearrange it
                into a coherent narrative...  You're literally describing steelmanning, which GP
                explicitly set out to do.  > It’s like a mental game that some of us cannot help
                but play.  Despite attempting to rephrase, you're still coming across as
                projecting your own internal issues onto GP's comment. Directly addressing the
                (worthwhile) points they made in their comments rather than attempting to
                analyze the meta of the basic nature of someone you've never met is the way to
                go.

        handedness: Pseudo-psychoanalyzing someone for explicitly steelmanning a subject
        seems particularly degrading to discussion.

    mongol: Let's say there is an earth killing event, and let's say there is an
    outpost on Mars with some people on it. How much does it really matter that some
    humans survive, in light of the enormous catastrohophe that killed all life on
    earth? Is it a very worthwhile objective for our species to persist a while
    longer, or should we not just accept that also life itself will will die out on
    geological or astronomical time scales?

        antonymoose: I would suppose there is a gap we face between true species-wide
        survival capability and where we sit today. I have no true idea how hard we must
        go to bridge that gap, but it’s quite hard and far.  I also see no reason to
        “lay down and die” as I feel is somewhat implied here. I think it’s a truly
        noble cause, but maybe I read too much sci-fi as a young lad.

            mrguyorama: No matter what anyone does, the universe will end, and reality will
            stop changing.  Everything dies. Deal with it.  Instead of empowering shithead
            grifters who promise you a way out, grow trees to create shade for people you
            will never know. You do that by improving things, not burning limited resources
            on a conman.

                icepush: If this outcome is guaranteed, why hasn't it already happened ?

                    ben_w: Because we exist inside time, not outside it.

                    olyjohn: How do you know it hasn't?

                    AlexandrB: Same reason you're not dead yet.

        icepush: The whole point of the space stuff is not accepting all life dying out
        on any timescale.

            Juliate: Even rocks don’t last. What do you expect?

    gf000: Musk's whole mission is to scam even more people. Unfortunately people
    still buy his bullshit even though he couldn't deliver on anything, and just
    converts one failure to hyping up his next idiotic product.  (Yes, I know what
    steel manning is)

        jsumrall: Couldn’t deliver on anything?

    grim_io: A data center in space is probably toast after some years of space
    radiation.  High performance chips are made for the shielded atmosphere. Imagine
    the cost launching all the extra shielding that you don't need on earth.  It is
    beyond stupid. Comical levels. I can't believe people are trying to find any
    justification.

        antonymoose: I’m not the right type of engineer to know and, hell, software
        largely isn’t engineering anyway…  Can you not provide any type of shielding at
        scale to wrap a (small, not Google tier) data center? To be honest my criticism
        with TFA is its focus on “you can’t do massive scale” rather than the premise
        entirely.

            estimator7292: Yes, but the added mass makes it prohibitively expensive.
            Shielding is heavy and every kilogram of added payload results in a geometric
            increase in fuel load.  The rocket equation will kick your ass every time.

    estimator7292: The problem of datacenters in space and knowledge
    preservation/disaster redundancy are entirely disjoint.  Datacenters in space
    have a lifespan measured in years. Single-digit years. Communicating with such
    an installation requires relatively advanced technology. In an extinction level
    crisis, there will be extremely little chance of finding someone with the
    equipment, expertise, and power to download bulk data. And don't forget that you
    have less than a decade to access this data before the constellation either
    fails or deorbits.  Meanwhile people who actually care about preserving
    knowledge in a doomsday crisis have created film reels containing a dump of
    GitHub and enough preamble that civilizations in the far future can reconstruct
    an x86 machine from scratch. These are buried under glaciers on earth.  We've
    also launched (something like) a microfilm dump of knowledge to the moon which
    can be recovered and read manually any time within the next several hundred or
    thousand years.  Datacenters in space don't solve any of the problems posed
    because they simply will not last long enough.

    kklisura: If that's really the case: wouldn't merging or collaborating with
    Nvidia make more sense then with xAI?

    Juliate: A sum or product of human knowledge is not humanity: that specific
    mission (putting it into space for preservation or contact) has been done
    (Voyagers and others) and is done continuously (radiowaves).  Making a dent into
    making humans a multiplanetary species requires making a lot of companion
    species as well; the task requires much more elementary stuff (relative to the
    mission), at the ground level, than Musk is demonstrating to do (at technical,
    entrepreneurial and political level).  This is a con, from the start. It just
    worked so far so some people fall for it.

redwood: I'd be curious to know simply how large the thermal radiator necessary
to keep a typical GPU server cooled would be. Do they completely dwarf the
server size? Can you do something with some esoteric material that is not
particularly load-bearing but holds up well in space to get around some of these
challenges?

heisenbit: Data centers in space are the logical progression from the multi
trillion business of m2m and edge computing. It removes all physical limits to
investment.

    gf000: You mean physical reality

ortusdux: Is there any insight into how Starlink solved cooling? One 'expert'
insisted that there is no reason to expect that data center satellites would
generate any more heat than starlinks.

    thfuran: Those have a power budget of about 1 rack. I would expect a datacenter
    satellite to need more cooling if it has more compute.

        morshu9001: And 1 ML rack uses the power of like 10 regular racks

            morshu9001: Oh and even a non-ML server rack uses more power than a networking
            rack

    fwip: So, most of the power that Starlink satellites use go into the comms,
    right? Blasting out electromagnetic radiation to receiver stations on earth, and
    also the laser(?) backhaul between satellites.  Modulo some efficiency losses,
    most of the electricity it generates is leaving the satellite. Contrast with a
    datacenter, where most of the energy is spent heating up the chips, and the rest
    is spent moving the heat away from those chips.

retube: It's lala land nonsense.  - Data centres need a lot of power = giant
vast solar panels  - Data centres need a lot of cooling. That's some almighty
heatsinks you're going need  - They will need to be radiation-hardened to avoid
memory corruption = even more mass  - The hardware will be redundant in like 2
years tops and will need replacing to stay competitive  - Data centres are about
100x bigger (not including solar panels and heat sinks) than the biggest thing
we've ever put in space  Tesla is losing market share (and rank increasingly
poorly against alternatives), his robots are gonna fail, this datacentre
ambition needs to break the laws of physics, grok/twitter is a fake news pedo-
loving cesspit that's gonna be regulated into oblivion. Its only down from here
on out.

    cyberax: > - The hardware will be redundant in like 2 years tops and will need
    replacing to stay competitive  Hey! It can be de-orbited onto the location of
    your choosing. I bet you can sell this service to the DoD!  Barring that, you
    can sell it on the global market to the highest bidder.

    geoffeg: Maybe instead of housing life, civilizations develop Dyson's spheres to
    house data centers. Solar panels on the interior, thermal radiators on the
    exterior and the data centers make up the structure in between. Combine that Von
    Neumann probes and you've got a fun new Fermi paradox hypothesis!

        sfink: Don't combine it with von Neumann probes and you've solved the Fermi
        paradox: a civilization that puts that much work into computing power is either
        doing the equivalent of mining crypto and going nowhere, or is doing AI and is
        so dependent on it that they inevitably form a vast echo chamber (echo sphere?)
        that only wants to talk to itself (itselves?) and can't bear to be left out by
        adding the latency unavoidably added by distance.  tl;dr: civilizations advanced
        enough to travel between stars end up trapped by the resources and physics
        required to keep up with the Joneses.

Terr_: I'm convinced that >30% of this comes from ideas leaking out of fiction
such as like Neuromancer, and percolating through the minds of wealthy people
attracted to some of the concepts. Namely, the dream of being a hyper-wealthy
dynasty, above any earthly government, controlling an extraterritorial Las Vegas
Fiefdom In Space. (Which in the book, also hosted a powerful AI.)  Then they
work backwards, trying to figure out some economic engine to make it happen.
"Data centers" are (A) in-vogue for investment right now and (B) vaguely
plausible, at least compared to having a space-casino.

    turtletontine: I’ve come to think of interviews with people like Sam Altman as
    “freestyle science fiction.” They’re just saying stuff off the top of their
    head. Like you say, that often entails vague ideas from other sci fi percolating
    up and out, with no consideration of if they actually make sense. And like most
    freestyle, it’s usually pretty bad.

        Spooky23: That is possible because DOGE and their comrades gutted the SEC and
        indirectly FINRA like a fish. The government is run by confidence men running
        crypto scams.  That’s how the CFO of OpenAI can essentially say “we need a
        Federal bailout”, and then turn around and say “lol just joking”.

            TheOtherHobbes: [checks today's bitcoin price]  Oh.  Is it below the level where
            mining and blockchain updates become uneconomic yet?

        DANmode: Your dad can’t tell the difference.  If they get 3/10 things right, and
        60 Minutes highlights those in the next interview, they’re set!

        Cthulhu_: I'd say they're basically floating on the success of previous sci-fi
        ideas that they made a reality; reusable rockets at a fraction of the price of
        NASA or ESA launches for example, or self-driving electric cars (the electric
        part was a success, the self-driving, not so much).

    mbb70: That's not fair! Sometimes the ideas come from Snow Crash, which gave us
    the Metaverse because Zuckerberg wanted to cut a guy in half with a katana from
    a motorcycle.

        Avicebron: Wait is that why they didn't put legs on anyone?

            ben_w: Wow, now you say it, that finally makes sense. Especially given it looked
            stupid and all the other VR chat solutions could already do legs.

            jollyllama: I always assumed they were copying the Wii Miis

        shermantanktop: It also gave us Mechanical Turk and microdrones!

    fullshark: This idea came from musk wanting to fold his X and xAI investments in
    with his (likely successful) spaceX IPO.

        MagicMoonlight: Yeah, if he gets more SpaceX shares in exchange for the xAI
        garbage shares then he wins, because the SpaceX shares will sell well.

            an0malous: Also he can launder government funding for his AI company now

            ncruces: He can also hide his garbage shares behind a too big to fail, essential
            for national security, business.

        Cthulhu_: Yup, likewise Starlink - while space internet is an interesting and
        viable concept (whether it'll earn itself back is another question, I'm not
        convinced), the real motivation behind it was to create demand for many SpaceX
        launches. There have been 352 Starlink launches [0] so far, out of 596 total
        [1]. If it wasn't for Starlink, SpaceX would only have been operating at 1/3 to
        1/2 of what it does today, cutting into their "economics of scale". And they'll
        need demand to make Starship viable, the possible moon missions aren't enough to
        fund or justify the whole project. Hence also the ideas of colonising Mars,
        which - if someone is willing to pay for it - would create a large and steady
        demand for launches / flights.  [0]

    lofaszvanitt: A lot more. Everyone is chasing scifi ideas, ridiculous. This
    shows that even people with high IQ lack fantasy/imagination and creativity.
    They are intelligent robots.  So whenever I see here or anywhere else that your
    ideas mean nothing I just laugh at it. Of course, these come from people who are
    bland, doesn't have any imagination and they are not creative at all at all, but
    they have brute force, which is money.

    GuinansEyebrows: well, don't forget, freeside's initial moneymaker was a
    datahaven for less-reputable banks!

    scottyah: I mean definitely, and they're not shy about admitting it. They see
    cool stuff in imagination-land, think it's cool, and work to make it a reality.
    Many people have worked to make the fantastical things shown in Star Trek.

        ehnto: We're about as close as we have ever been to a holo-deck with VR/AR right
        now, but it is notable that it is still a fringe technology. I think basically
        no one cares about space data centres except the rule of cool enthusiasts in the
        technosphere.

            Cthulhu_: The harsh reality of economics and demand is hitting them. For years,
            Musk's ideas were funded by an overvalued Tesla stock and stupendous amounts of
            investor money, and currently it's being double down on with the amount of money
            being poured into AI and its necessary hardware.  But the demand / economic
            viability just isn't there. VR is cool but it's not mainstream. "Metaverse"
            exists and some companies are making good money off of it (Roblox, Fortnite,
            MMOs, etc), but nobody wanted Facebook's multi-billion-dollar-invested version
            of it because they just don't get it. I really hope all this nonsense collapses
            sooner rather than later and we go back to realistic and viable spending.  Large
            investments don't translate to results.

                Terr_: I have to say, this quip has been putting in a lot of work over the last
                decade for me: "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."

    threecheese: Stole Grok from Heinlein. At least it’s a good heuristic for
    people-I-don’t-have-to-take-seriously.

        gowld: More likely, stole grok from nerds who learned grok from Heinlein.

        rswail: Heinlein's sci fi didn't age well, because it was written for juveniles
        and then later his social ideas overtook his sci fi ones.  He had the same blind
        spots that Ayn Rand did, but perhaps better informed of the fascist-adjacent US
        culture.  One of the good sci fi/social ideas he had was about what it meant to
        "grok" something. groklaw.net of happy memory was exactly what that verb was
        supposed to mean, dive into something until you understand it at a molecular
        level.  The fact that Musk et al have stolen terms like "grok" and even
        "cyberspace" as if they own them is something I loathe.

    digiown: > above any earthly government  Anti satellite weapons are a thing.
    Besides, the more vulnerable part becomes you as a person rather than the
    equipment. There's no space colony yet, and even if there is, the supplies can
    be easily held hostage by an earthly government too.

    ehnto: I am surprised the space casino hasn't been done to be honest. Or some
    kind of space resort. I guess we are stepping across the stepping stones now,
    with private space flights, and private space fairing companies. Maybe it is
    just a matter of time before the Crystal Palace sees its first billionare
    clients.

        turtlesdown11: > I am surprised the space casino hasn't been done to be honest.
        Or some kind of space resort.  The ISS is the single most expensive thing built
        by humankind ($100b+). What makes you think that building a "space casino" or
        "space resort" is commercially viable?

    aftbit: Some of it might come from True Names by Vernor Vinge too, where the
    cheapest place to buy bulk compute is giant satellites orbiting on geosync
    orbit. This became possible because they were developed early on for
    communications, then obsoleted by Starlink-like LEO constellations, so they have
    a ton of spare undesirable high-latency capacity to sell. In this fictional
    world, ground-based fiber optic networks never happened, at least not at the
    kind of scale they did in the real world.  But because that's fiction, Vinge can
    just handwave away all the hard engineering problems for sci-fi flavor.

ozim: *Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost effective relative
to normal data centers*.  Disagree there are bunch of scenarios where Data
Centers in space make sense. Like nuclear annihilation and having vaults across
the globe to communicate and get back lost information because ground data
centers would be wiped out by EMP from blasts.

    proggy: Has it occurred to anyone that you can put computers underground? In
    this apocalyptic scenario you are describing, how do you expect the ground based
    command and control infrastructure to survive? Satellites are 100% reliant on
    ground based operations. That is a hard requirement. And if you put the command
    and control underground, might as well just skip the whole space based plan and
    just put the data underground.

        grim_io: And here I thought Musk's fans are all about digging holes in the
        ground. The flamethrower fumes might have caused temporary amnesia.

            ozim: To say so I am not a Musk fan - I am sci-fi fan and I make imaginary/silly
            stuff up on my own.  I also like reading how people argue with not what I wrote
            but with what they imagined I wrote.

                grim_io: It was not my intention to single you out, my apologies.  There is
                nothing wrong to imagine anything you like. But if you do it as a CEO, i
                personally consider that as fraud. Guess I'm weird and old-fashioned like that.

        ozim: Why is it hard requirement?  You can make some part of operations on high
        orbit that won’t decay as much then more ops on lower orbits that decay faster.
        If you put stuff underground it is much harder to communicate.

    0cf8612b2e1e: After the bulk of humanity is wiped out, it will be a comfort that
    I can still use AI to generate dank memes.

    Ekaros: In that case wouldn't space also get wiped by EMP? Seems like disabling
    satellites would be good move if you have a few nukes to spare.

    burkaman: This is not a counterpoint, it is a post discussing the same topic but
    it doesn't address any of the points in this article.

    turtletontine: That post does not appear to address or acknowledge any of these
    problems: 1) thermal management in space, 2) radiation degrading the onboard
    silicon, 3) you can’t upgrade data centers in orbit

arjie: It doesn't make any sense to me either, but there are lots of things like
that where the other thing is harder. As an example, a thing people say online a
lot is something like "Why do the techbros build self-driving cars instead of
just putting it on rails for efficiency and then they could call it a TRAIN?"
The answer to that is that coordination problems are really hard. Much harder
even than what are currently unsolved engineering problems. In fact, SpaceX can
only launch from California because they have DOD coverage for their launches.
Otherwise the California Coastal Commission et al. would have blocked them
entirely. Perhaps the innovation for affordable space Internet is combining it
with mixed-use technology.  The truth is that in America today self-driving cars
(regulated by a state board run by bureaucrats) are easier to build than trains
(regulated by every property owner on the train route). Mark Zuckerberg tried to
spend some money evaluating a train across the Bay and had to give up. But
Robotaxi service is live in San Francisco.  So if there is an angle that makes
sense to me it's that they anticipate engineering challenges beatable in a way
where regulatory challenges are not.

    constantius: Interesting insight. I can think of some objections, but they don't
    change your point.  I also checked out your blog and got 2 interesting articles
    in 2 tries. If you have some personal favourites and listing them is not a
    bother, I'd be happy to read them.

        arjie: That's awfully kind of you to say! I added a section to the Main Page
        listing a couple of ones that people have mentioned to me before, though it's a
        bit of a cluttered page so I doubt it works as it stands.  A few things I think
        of more frequently than they affect my life are:  *
        https://wiki.roshangeorge.dev/w/Abolish_The_First_Lady - arguing that the FLOTUS
        role shouldn't exist  *
        https://wiki.roshangeorge.dev/w/Upward_Mobility,_Downward_So... - perhaps a less
        original idea that economic mobility leads to poorly performing lower-paying
        services.  * https://wiki.roshangeorge.dev/w/Blog/2026-01-17/Citogenesis - an
        example of one way that factoids get upgraded to facts

            constantius: Thanks, I'll read through those (and Citogenesis was one of the two
            that I stumbled upon!). I find a lot of value in observing out-of-the-
            box/second-order reasoning, your blog fits the bill!

                arjie: Thank you for your kind words :)

wrs: Next up, the Boring Company gets imaginary contract for underground
datacenters, is now valued at $500B.

    m463: there was an article recently about a company wanting to put nuclear
    reactors at the bottom of very deep boreholes (like km deep).  I thought that
    was actually quite interesting/practical, because if there is a problem, you can
    just bury the problem.  not like tmi/fukushima/chernobyl

        DaedalusII: Interesting idea. 2km deep could work. I'm not sure how cooling or
        maintenance would work.  Depth below surface | Typical temperature (°C) |
        Indicative cost to drill 1.2 m diameter hole  500 m               | 15–25
        | $5–10 million  1 km                | 25–40                    | $10–20 million
        2 km                | 50–70                    | $25–45 million  3 km
        | 75–100                   | $50–80 million  4 km                | 100–130
        | $90–140 million  5 km                | 130–160                  | $150–250
        million

            m463: maybe not the article I read, but similar:
            https://spectrum.ieee.org/underground-nuclear-reactor-deep-f...

    kklisura: Nah. They get contract for mining on Mars, valued north of $1T.

sollewitt: The bigger issue: datacenters in space are disposable. All the
extremely recyclable aluminum, silica - you extract it, manufacture it and
instead of recycling it when it’s done you incinerate it in the atmosphere and
scatter the ashes far and wide across the earth, the harder to recapture later.
You do this when the most fragile part in the system fails. Solar panels good
for 25 years but the SSDs burn out after 2? Incinerate the lot!  This kind of
thinking is late capitalist brain rot. This kind of waste should be a crime.

    timmmmmmay: Aluminum is 8% of the earth's crust and silicon is 28%; I think
    we're good

Joker_vD: I am willing to bet the whole xAI/SpaceX merger is simply a ploy by
Musk to evade releasing accurate historical information about SpaceX's finances.
How much did it actually cost SpaceX to launch a kilogram of payload into space
each year? How much is NASA actually donating them, per each year?  I mean, I
still remember promises of $1000-per-kg for space launches, and how e.g.
Gigafactory will produce half of the world battery supply, and other non-
scientific fiction peddled by Musk. Remember when SpaceX suggested in 2019 that
the US Army could use its Starship rockets to transport troops and supplies
across the planet in minutes? I do. By the way, have they finished testing
Starship yet, is it ready?

Garlef: I guess the xAI/SpaceX thing is mainly a financial move and they made up
an interesting story to give it some context

ww520: Space offers some unique benefits that enable computing that’s impossible
or very hard to do on earth. E.g. Super conducting computing is possible, which
can be thousands times to millions times faster than current CPU while using
very little energy. When the satellite moves in the shade of the earth,
temperature drops significantly. It can be low enough to enable superconducting.
When the satellite moves under the sun, the solar panel can start charging up
the battery to power the ongoing operation.

    emkoemko: i don't understand? you won't insulate the craft from the sun? and you
    expect the craft to get rid of its heat just from being behind the earth for a
    moment?

        ww520: When did I say no insulation? If it took only one moment for the
        satellite to fly by behind the whole earth, its speed is so great that it would
        be flung out of the solar system.

        people like you did. But taking the leap worked pretty well, even if it was
        tough at the beginning.

            mediaman: Africa, Europe, America, Mars. I wonder if there is something about
            one of these that makes them unlike the others.  Actually, why not colonize
            Venus instead? Sure, it will be hard, at first, with all the sulphuric acid and
            intense heat and whatnot, but we colonized America, so why not Venus?

mrcwinn: I can assure this author: strapping a company that lights money on fire
(today, maybe not tomorrow) to a cash flow enterprise makes the IPO harder, not
easier, in the absence of credible plan. The market speculates, but it’s not
being completely irrational. I’d actually be surprised if we didn’t have
factories or data centers in space one day.

beloch: I would not assume cooling has been worked out.  Space is a vacuum.
i.e. The lack-of-a-thing that makes a thermos great at keeping your drink hot.
A satellite is, if nothing else, a fantastic thermos.  A data center in space
would necessarily rely completely on cooling by radiation, unlike a terrestrial
data center that can make use of convection and conduction. You can't just pipe
heat out into the atmosphere or build a heat exchanger. You can't exchange heat
with vacuum.  You can only radiate heat into it.  Heat is going to limit the
compute that can be done in a satellite data centre and radiative cooling
solutions are going to massively increase weight. It makes far more sense to
build data centers in the arctic.  Musk is up to something here.  This could be
another hyperloop (i.e. A distracting promise meant to sabotage competition).
It could be a legal dodge.  It could be a power grab.  What it will not be is a
useful source of computing power.  Anyone who takes this venture seriously is
probably going to be burned.

    jcgrillo: A glaring lack of oceans to boil

    atleastoptimal: Its very simple, xAI needs money to win the AI race, so best
    option is to attach to Elon’s moneybank (spacex) to get cash without dilution

        ben_w: That may be the plan, but this is also a great way for GDPR's maximum
        fine, based on global revenue, to bite on SpaceX's much higher revenue. And
        without any real room for argument.

        iknowstuff: Remember how he argued for Tesla’s Solarcity acquisition because
        solar roofs?  Data centers in space are the same kind of justification imo.

            MobiusHorizons: Solar roofs are much more practical to be honest.

                undersuit: Putting solar roofs on a building? For a car company?

                    MobiusHorizons: In comparison to datacenters in space yes. Solar roofs are
                    already a profitable business, just not likely to be high growth. Datacenters in
                    space are unlikely to ever make financial sense, and even if they did, they are
                    very unlikely to show high growth due to continuing ongoing high capital
                    expenses inherent in the model.

                        ben_w: I think a better critique of space-based data centres is not that they
                        never become high growth, it's just that when they do it implies the economy is
                        radically different from the one we live in to the degree that all our current
                        ideas about wealth and nations and ownership and morality and crime & punishment
                        seem quaint and out-dated.  The "put 500 to 1000 TW/year of AI satellites into
                        deep space" for example, that's as far ahead of the entire planet Earth today as
                        the entire planet Earth today is from specifically just Europe right after the
                        fall of Rome. Multiplicatively, not additively.  There's no reason to expect any
                        current business (or nation, or any given asset) to survive that kind of
                        transition intact.

                    mayoff: For an electrification company.

                    rsynnott: It's obviously a pretty weird thing for a car company to do, and is
                    probably just a silly idea in general (it has little obvious benefit over normal
                    solar panels, and is vastly more expensive and messy to install), but in
                    principle it could at least work, FSOV work. The space datacenter thing is a
                    nonsensical fantasy.

                    kuschku: There's a synergy effect here - Tesla sells you a solar roof and car
                    bundle, the roof comes without a battery (making it cheaper) and the car now
                    gets a free recharge whenever you're home (making it cheaper in the long term).
                    Of course that didn't work out with this specific acquisition, but overall it's
                    at least a somewhat reasonable idea.

        Findecanor: > win the AI race  I keep seeing that term, but if it does not mean
        "AI arms race" or "AI surveillance race", what does it mean?  Those are the only
        explanations that I have found, and neither is any race that I would like to see
        anyone win.

            strange_quark: It’s a framing device to justify the money, the idea being the
            first company (to what?) will own the market.

            totetsu: It’s a graft to keep people distracted and allow for positioning as we
            fall off the end of the fossil energy boom.

            ekidd: A significant number of AI companies and investors are hoping to build a
            machine god. This is batshit insane, but I suppose it might be possible. Which
            wouldn't make it any more sane.  But when they say, "Win the AI race," they
            mean, "Build the machine god first." Make of this what you will.

                FeteCommuniste: On the edge of my seat waiting to see what hits us first, a
                massive economic collapse when the hype runs out, or the Torment Nexus.

                    reverius42: It really seems like the market has locked in on one of those two
                    things being a guaranteed outcome at this point.

            bigstrat2003: Big tech businesses are convinced that there must be some
            profitable business model for AI, and are undeterred by the fact that none has
            yet been found. They want to be the first to get there, raking in that sweet
            sweet money (even though there's no evidence yet that there is money to be made
            here). It's industry-wide FOMO, nothing more.

                Nystik: It will be genuinely interesting to see what happens first, the
                discovery of such a model, or the bubble bursting.

                hannasanarion: People keep saying this but it's simply untrue. AI inference is
                profitable. Openai and Anthropic have 40-60% gross margins. If they stopped
                training and building out future capacity they would already be raking in cash.
                They're losing money now because they're making massive bets on future capacity
                needs. If those bets are wrong, they're going to be in very big trouble when
                demand levels off lower than expected. But that's not the same as demand being
                zero.

                    adgjlsfhk1: those gross profit margins aren't that useful since training at
                    fixed capacity is continually getting cheaper, so there's a treadmill effect
                    where staying in business requires training new models constantly to not fall
                    behind. If the big companies stop training models, they only have a year before
                    someone else catches up with way less debt and puts them out of business.

                        HDThoreaun: Only if training new models leads to better models. If the newly
                        trained models are just a bit cheaper but not better most users wont switch.
                        Then the entrenched labs can stop training so much and focus on profitable
                        inference

                            kuschku: If they really have 40-60% gross margins, as training costs go down,
                            the newly trained models could offer the same product at half the price.

                                HDThoreaun: Well thats why the labs are building these app level products like
                                claude code/codex to lock their users in. Most of the money here is in business
                                subscriptions I think, how much savings would be required for businesses to
                                switch to products that arent better, just cheaper?

                                    kuschku: I think the real lock-in is in "CLAUDE.md" and similar rulesets, which
                                    are heavily AI specific.

                    mbesto: > Openai and Anthropic have 40-60% gross margins.  Stop this trope
                    please. We (1) don't really know what their margins are and (2) because of the
                    hard tie-in to GPU costs/maintenance we don't know (yet) what the useful life
                    (and therefore associated OPEX) is of GPUs.  >  If they stopped training and
                    building out future capacity they would already be raking in cash.  That's like
                    saying "if car companies stopped researching how to make their cars more
                    efficient, safer, more reliable they'd be more profitable"

                FranklinJabar: Typically in capitalism, if there is any profit, the race is
                towards zero profit. The alternative is a race to bankrupt all competitors at
                enormous cost in order to jack up prices and recoup the losses as a monopoly (or
                duopoly, or some other stable arrangement). I assume the latter is the goal, but
                that means burning through like 50%+ of american gdp growth just to be undercut
                by china.  Imo I would be extremely angry if I owned any spacex equity. At least
                nvidia might be selling to china in the short term... what's the upside for
                spacex?

                    WalterBright: > The alternative is a race to bankrupt all competitors at
                    enormous cost in order to jack up prices and recoup the losses as a monopoly  I
                    don't know of an instance of this happening successfully.

                        kuschku: Walmart? It's certainly more successful in physical markets

                            WalterBright: See Amazon

                                kuschku: Are you saying that Amazon is a successful monopoly, or that Amazon is
                                even with massive expenses still not a full monopoly?

                                    WalterBright: Walmart competes with Amazon.

                                FranklinJabar: Different markets entirely—I can't walk into amazon, and I don't
                                order online from Walmart.

                        jabron: Amazon

                            WalterBright: See Walmart

                        FranklinJabar: taxi apps, delivery apps, social media apps—all of these require
                        a market that's extremely expensive to build but is also extremely lucrative to
                        exploit and difficult to unseat. You see this same model with big-box stores
                        displacing local stores. The secret to making a lot of money under capitalism is
                        to have a lot of money to begin with.

                            WalterBright: Taxis are a government created monopoly.  None of the big-box
                            stores have created a monopoly.  Amazon unseated behemoth Walmart with a mere
                            $300,000 startup capital.  Musk founded his empire with $28,000.

            atleastoptimal: Being too far ahead for competitors to catch up, similar to how
            google won browsers, amazon won distribution, etc

        georgemcbay: > xAI needs money to win the AI race  Off on a tangent here but I'd
        love for anyone to seriously explain how they believe the "AI race" is
        economically winnable in any meaningful way.  Like what is the believed
        inflection point that changes us from the current situation (where all of the
        state-of-the-art models are roughly equal if you squint, and the open models are
        only like one release cycle behind) to one where someone achieves a clear
        advantage that won't be reproduced by everyone else in the "race" virtually
        immediately.

            CamperBob2: They ultimately want to own everyone's business processes, is my
            guess.  You can only jack up the subscription prices on coding models and
            chatbots by so much, as everyone has already noted... but if OpenAI runs your
            "smart" CRM and ERP flows, they can really tighten the screws.

                adventured: If you have the greatest coding agent under your thumb, eventually
                you orient it toward eating everything else instead of letting everybody else
                use your agent to build software & make money. Go forward ten years, it's highly
                likely GPT, Gemini, maybe Claude - they'll have consumed a very large amount of
                the software ecosystem. Why should MS Office exist at all as a separate piece of
                software? The various pieces of Office will be trivial for the GPT (etc) of ten
                years out to fully recreate & maintain internally for OpenAI. There's no
                scenario where they don't do what the platforms always do: eat the ecosystem,
                anything they can. If a platform can consume a thing that touches it, it will.
                Office? Dead. Box? Dead. DropBox? Dead. And so on. They'll move on anything that
                touches users (from productivity software to storage). You're not going to pay
                $20-$30 for GPT and then pay for DropBox too, OpenAI will just do an Amazon
                Prime maneuver and stack more onto what you get to try to kill everyone else.
                Google of course has a huge lead on this move already with their various
                prominent apps.

                    notahacker: Dropbox is actually a great example of why this isn't likely to
                    happen. Deeper pocketed competition with tons of cloud storage and the ability
                    to build easy upload workflows (including directly into software with massive
                    install base) exists, and showed an active interest in competing with them.
                    Still doing OK  Office's moat is much bigger (and its competition already free).
                    "New vibe coded features every week" isn't an obvious reason for Office users to
                    switch away from the platform  their financial models and all their clients rely
                    on to a new upstart software suite

            fhd2: I _think_ the idea is that the first one to hit self improving AGI will,
            in a short period of time, pull _so_ far ahead that competition will quickly die
            out, no longer having any chance to compete economically.  At the same time,
            it'd give the country controlling it so much economic, political and military
            power that it becomes impossible to challenge.  I find that all to be a bit of a
            stretch, but I think that's roughly what people talking about "the AI race" have
            in mind.

            ExoticPearTree: > Off on a tangent here but I'd love for anyone to seriously
            explain how they believe the "AI race" is economically winnable in any
            meaningful way.  Because the first company to have a full functioning AGI will
            most likely be the most valuable in the world. So it is worth all the effort to
            be the first.

                georgemcbay: > Because the first company to have a full functioning AGI will
                most likely be the most valuable in the world.  This may be what they are going
                for, but there are two effectively religious beliefs with this line of thinking,
                IMO.  The first is that LLMs lead to AGI.  The second is that even if the first
                did turn out to be true that they wouldn't all stumble into AGI at the same
                time, which given how relatively lockstep all of the models have been for the
                past couple of years seems far more likely to me than any single company having
                a breakthrough the others don't immediately reproduce.

            theshrike79: Like any other mega-scaler, theyre just playing Money Chicken.
            Everyone is spending crazy amounts of money in the hopes that the competition
            will tap out because they can't afford it anymore.  Then they can cool down on
            their spending and increase prices to a sustainable level because they have an
            effective monopoly.

                a_victorp: Money Chicken is the best term I've seen for this!

        danw1979: I’m not certain spacex is generating much cash right now ?  Starship
        development is consuming billions.  F9 & Starlink are probably profitable ?  I’d
        say this is more shifting of the future burden of xAI to one of his companies he
        knows will be a hit stonk when it goes public, where enthusiasm is unlikely to
        be dampened by another massive cash drain on the books.

    xupybd: I think he has rocket company that needs more work.  Sufficient hype
    funds more work for his rocket company.  The more work they have the faster they
    can develop the systems to get to Mars. His pet project.  I really think it's
    that simple.

        croddin: Starlink and Falcon 9 have been an  excellent pairing, Falcon 9
        partially reusable rockets created a lot launch capacity and starlink filled the
        demand. Starship if it meets its goals will create more launch fully reusable
        supply by orders of magnitude, but there is not the demand for all that launch
        capacity. Starlink can take some of it but probably not all so they need to find
        a customer to fill it in order to build up enough to have the volume to
        eventually colonize mars.

            ezst: > colonize mars  Oh, that crap again.

            belter: Nobody colonizing Mars. Get real. The most likely outcome, is him
            landing on a cell when the full Epstein files come out.

                deepfriedchokes: The most likely outcome is that no one will be punished for
                anything in the Epstein files.

            bunderbunder: Going to Mars is not a serious goal.  We can tell because it’s not
            being treated as a serious goal. 100% of the focus is on the big vroom vroom
            part that’s really exciting to kids who get particularly excited by things that
            go vroom, and approximately 0% of the focus is on developing all the less
            glamorous but equally essential components of a successful Mars mission, like
            making sure the crew stays healthy.

                kentm: As much as I'd like to see boots on the ground on Mars this is where I'm
                at.  In my uneducated opinion, while building the massive rocket is incredibly
                difficult, its probably the easiest part of a Mars mission.

            snarf21: Correct, and this is meant to attract the same investors and Bulls that
            already think Mars colonies is a solved problem, just need a few more years to
            run some tests. As with all, it is only about making himself richer.

    idontwantthis: One man able to put a data center worth of mass in orbit is one
    man able to crash a datacenter worth of mass into Earth anywhere he wants.

        recursive: Not a given.  Re enter the atmosphere.  Sure.  Avoid vaporization?
        Much harder problem.

            debatem1: There is some evidence to suggest that spacex knows how to reenter an
            object without burning it up.

                duskwuff: Sometimes without even meaning to:
                https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/spacex-cbc-debris-s...

                TheOtherHobbes: The engineering overlap between between a small object designed
                for reentry and a flying (crashing...) warehouse is not a circle.  Once upon a
                time there was a bonkers "rods from god" mass bomb idea, but that didn't work
                either.

            reppap: I think it's actually the other way around, satellites need to be
            specifically designed to burn up fast in the atmosphere. See for example the
            warnings about space debris from Chinese satellites not designed with this in
            mind.

            idontwantthis: 100 tons of steel will not vaporize before it hits the ground

    aunty_helen: The equation has a ^4 to the temperature. If you raise the
    temperature of your radiator by ~50 degrees you double its emission capacity.
    This is well within the range of specialised phase change compressors, aka fancy
    air conditioning pumps.  Next up in the equation is surface emissivity which
    we’ve got a lot of experience in the automotive sector.  And finally surface
    area, once again, getting quite good here with nanotechnology.  Yes he’s
    distracting, no it’s not as impossible as many people think.

        sfink: > And finally surface area, once again, getting quite good here with
        nanotechnology.  So your hot thing is radiating directly onto the next hot thing
        over, the one that also needs to cool down?

        vel0city: > Next up in the equation is surface emissivity which we’ve got a lot
        of experience in the automotive sector.  My car doesn't spend too much time
        driving in vacuum, does yours?

            MillionOClock: Let's just hope the person you are responding to isn't Elon Musk!

                vel0city: I wouldn't say that roadster isn't doing much driving but dang is it
                drifting!

            aunty_helen: Engine bays have a lot of design go into where to keep heat and
            where to get rid of it. You can look up thermal coatings and ceramics etc.

                vel0city: Sure and it all routes to dump the heat to...where again? A vacuum? Or
                to a radiator with a fan with some kind of cooler fluid/gas from the environment
                constantly flowing through it?  Seems like quite a massive difference to ignore.

        jamiek88: This makes zero sense.

        wat10000: Raise the temperature of your radiator by 50 degrees and you double
        its emission capacity. Or put your radiator in the atmosphere and multiply its
        heat exchange capacity by a factor of a thousand.  It's not physically
        impossible. Of course not. It's been done thousands of times already. But it
        doesn't make any economic sense. It's like putting a McDonald's at the top of
        Everest. Is it possible? Of course. Is it worth the enormous difficulty and
        expense to put one there? Not even a little.

            aunty_helen: For thousands of years we never even looked to Mount Everest, then
            some bloke on the fiver said he’d give it a shot. Nowadays anyone with the cash
            and commitment can get the job done.  Same with datacenters in space, not today,
            but in 1000 years definitely, 100 surely, 10?  As for the economics, it makes
            about as much sense as running jet engines at full tilt to power them.

                tialaramex: > some bloke on the fiver said he’d give it a shot  Hillary (he
                features on the NZ Five Dollar note) was one of those guys who does things for
                no good reason. He also went to both poles. This only tells us that it is indeed
                possible, but not that it's desirable or will become routine.

                wat10000: If we define a data center as a place where computers run primarily to
                serve distant users, then we've had data centers in space for decades.  Nobody
                should doubt that it's possible, since it's been done. It just doesn't make any
                sense to do it purely for the sake of having computers do things that could be
                done on the ground.  There's nothing weird about using jet engines to make
                electricity. The design of a turbine designed to generate thrust isn't
                necessarily that different from a turbine designed to generate electricity. You
                can buy a new Avon gas turbine generator today, the same engine used in the
                Canberra, Comet, Draken, and many others. It makes about a million times more
                economic sense than putting GPUs in space to run LLMs.

        marcosdumay: > aka fancy air conditioning pumps  Yeah, pumps, tubes, and fluids
        are some of the worst things to add to a satellite. It's probably cheaper to use
        more radiators.  Maybe it's possible to make something economical with Peltier
        elements. But it's still not even a budget problem yet, it's not plainly not
        viable.  > getting quite good here with nanotechnology  Small features and
        fractal surfaces are useless here.

            aunty_helen: My dude, heat pipes were invented for satellites and there’s people
            walking around with piezo pumps in their phones these days. We’re getting close.
            Peltiers generate a lot of heat to get the job done so even though electricity
            is pretty much free, probably not a sure bet.

            pclmulqdq: Peltiers and heat pipes don't remove heat, they just move it. You
            still need the radiator.

        stackghost: Even if you create a material with surface emissivity of 1.0:  -
        let's say 8x 800W GPUs and neglect the CPU, that's 6400W  - let's further assume
        the PSU is 100% efficient  - let's also assume that you allow the server
        hardware to run at 77 degrees C, or 350K, which is already pretty hot for modern
        datacenter chips.  Your radiator would need to dissipate those 6400W, requiring
        it to be almost 8 square meters in size.  That's a lot of launch mass. Adding 50
        degrees will reduce your required area to only about 4.4 square meters with the
        consequence that chip temps will rise by 50 degrees also, putting them at 127
        degrees C.  No CPU I'm aware of can run at those temps for very long and most
        modern chips will start to self throttle above about 100

            aunty_helen: Hence the fancy air conditioning pumps

                stackghost: ... on satellites?

                    aunty_helen: Yes, that’s what we’re talking about. Data centers in space.  You
                    put the cold side of the phase change on the internal cooling loop, step up the
                    external cooling loop as high temp as you can and then circulate that through
                    the radiators. You might even do this step up more than once.  Imagine the data
                    center like a box, you want it to be cold inside, and there’s a compressor, you
                    use to transfer heat from inside to outside, the outside gets hot, inside cold.
                    You then put a radiator on the back of the box and radiate the heat to the
                    darkness of space.  This is all very dependent on the biggest and cheapest
                    rockets in the world but it’s a tradeoff of convenience and serviceability for
                    unlimited free energy.

                        abenga: Why not use the unlimited free energy on terrestrial data centers then?
                        You can use solar power as we speak, no?

                            aunty_helen: Because the sun hides at night. Scientists have yet to figure out
                            where he goes. Until that happens it’s not a great power source.

                                direwolf20: What do the satellites do in earth's shadow?

                                    aunty_helen: Polar orbit. We’re already doing this.

                                        direwolf20: What do they do in earth's shadow in a polar orbit?

                                abenga: Overprovision solar and add batteries for the night, then. Whatever
                                amount of money and effort is required to make space data centers feasible
                                (launching, cooling, etc) cannot possibly be lower than just building solar
                                powered terrestrial data centers + batteries or alternative power sources. It is
                                just not as sexy a story to sell to investors as magic space computers.

    bagels: You can reject the heat by shedding hot mass, but only once.

        denkmoon: Cooling by mass effect style yeeting hot chunks of metal out the back.
        Where will they go, nobody knows!

            strange_quark: When the radiation burns out a GPU, just dump as much heat into
            it as possible and yeet it into the atmosphere. Ez.

                reverius42: Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! (are raining down on my

    eek2121: Not going to read the article, because Data centers in space = DOA is
    common sense to me, however, did the article really claim cooling wasn't an
    issue? Do they not understand the laws of thermodynamics, physics, etc?  Sure,
    space is cold. Good luck cooling your gear with a vacuum.  Don't even get me
    started on radiation, or even lack of gravity when it comes to trying to run
    high powered compute in space. If you think you are just going to plop a 1-4U
    server up there designed for use on earth, you are going to have some very
    interesting problems pop up. Anything not hardened for space is going to have a
    very high error/failure rate, and that includes anything socketed...

        tzs: > Not going to read the article, because Data centers in space = DOA is
        common sense to me, however, did the article really claim cooling wasn't an
        issue?  No. Nearly everyone that talks about data centers in space talks about
        cooling. The point of this article was to talk about other problems that would
        remain even if the most commonly talked about problems were solved.  It says:  >
        But even if we stipulate that radiation, cooling, latency, and launch costs are
        all solved, other fundamental issues still make orbital data centers, at least
        as SpaceX understands them, a complete fantasy.  and then talks about some of
        those other issues.

    lofaszvanitt: It will be the communications, not the compute part.

    TacticalCoder: Not disagreeing with you at all: that physics fact always come
    up. My honest question is: if it's a perfect thermos, what does, for example,
    the ISS do with the heat generated by computers and humans burning calories? The
    ISS is equipped with a mechanism to radiate excess heat into space? Or is the
    ISS slowly heating up but it's not a problem?

        cluckindan: Let me google that for you.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Active_Thermal_Contro...

        vidarh: The ISS has giant heat sinks[1]. Those heat sinks are necessary for just
        the modest heat generated on the ISS, and should give an idea of what a
        sattelite full of GPU's might require...  [1]
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Active_Thermal_Contro...

        jamiek88: The ISS has MASSIVE radiators. Most of its volume is radiator. 900
        cubic meters of space 2500 square meters of radiator.

        stouset: The TL;DR is they radiate it into space via large, high surface area
        arms that stick out of the station.

        breput: Massive radiators. In this photo[0], all of the light gray panels are
        thermal radiators. Note how they are nearly as large as the solar panels, which
        gives you an idea about the scale needed to radiate away 3-12 people's worth of
        heat (~1200 watts) + the heat generated by equipment.  [0] https://images-
        assets.nasa.gov/image/jsc2021e064215_alt/jsc2...

            OrvalWintermute: I agree, all the good papers definitely talk about custom
            designed radiators being used on the dark sides of data center in space.

            gpt5: The ISS is designed to emit 126kW of heat radiation between the active
            cooking systems and the solar array cooling system.

                adastra22: Which is less than a single rack of GPUs.

    lancewiggs: It's exiting the 5th best social network and the 10th (or worse)
    best AI company and selling them to a decent company.  It probably increases
    Elon's share of the combined entity.  It delivers on a promise to investors that
    he will make money for them, even as the underlying businesses are lousy.

        ojbyrne: Plus government backstop. The federal government (especially the
        current one) is not going to let SpaceX fail.

            mullingitover: Maybe not, but they might force it to sell at fire sale prices to
            another aerospace company that doesn't have the baggage.

        gpt5: I'm confused about the level of conversation here. Can we actually run the
        math on heat dissipation and feasibility?  A Starlink satellite uses about 5K
        Watts of solar power. It needs to dissipate around that amount (+ the sun power
        on it) just to operate. There are around 10K starlink satellites already in
        orbit, which means that the Starlink constellation is already effectively
        equivalent to a 50 Mega-watt (in a rough, back of the envelope feasibility way).
        Isn't 50MW already by itself equivalent to the energy consumption of a typical
        hyperscaler cloud?  Why is starlink possible and other computations are not?
        Starlink is also already financially viable. Wouldn't it also become
        significantly cheaper as we improve our orbital launch vehicles?

            space_fountain: It's like this. Everything about operating a datacenter in space
            is more difficult than it is to operate one on earth.  1. The capital costs are
            higher, you have to expend tons of energy to put it into orbit  2. The
            maintenance costs are higher because the lifetime of satellites is pretty low
            3. Refurbishment is next to impossible  4. Networking is harder, either you are
            ok with a relatively small datacenter or you have to deal with radio or laser
            links between satellites  For starlink this isn't as important. Starlink
            provides something that can't really be provided any other way, but even so just
            the US uses 176 terawatt-hours of power for data centers so starlink is 1/400th
            of that assuming your estimate is accurate (and I'm not sure it is, does it
            account for the night cycle?)

                murderfs: > The maintenance costs are higher because the lifetime of satellites
                is pretty low  Presumably they're planning on doing in-orbit propellant transfer
                to reboost the satellites so that they don't have to let their GPUs crash into
                the ocean...

                    sanex: Or maybe they want to just use them hard and deorbit them after three
                    yesrs?

                    JumpCrisscross: > Presumably they're planning on doing in-orbit propellant
                    transfer to reboost the satellites so that they don't have to let their GPUs
                    crash into the ocean  Hell, you're going to lose some fraction of chips to
                    entropy every year. What if you could process those into reaction mass?

                        falcor84: This brings a whole new dimension to that joke about how our software
                        used to leak memory, then file descriptors, then ec2 instances, and soon we'll
                        be leaking entire data centers. So essentially you're saying - let's convert
                        this into a feature.

                            lambdaone: It's certainly one way to do arena-based garbage collection.

                        3eb7988a1663: I believe that a modern GPU will burn out immediately. Chips for
                        space are using ancient process nodes with chunky sized components so that they
                        are more resilient to radiation. Deploying a 3nm process into space seems
                        unlikely to work unless you surround it with a foot of lead.

                            mike_hearn: Or cooling water/oil?

                                JumpCrisscross: > Or cooling water/oil?  Oh. You surround it with propellant. In
                                a propellant depot.

                        notahacker: Reminds me of the proposal to deorbit end of life satellites by
                        puncturing their lithium batteries :)  The physics of consuming bits of old chip
                        in an inefficient plasma thruster probably work, as do the crawling robots and
                        crushers needed for orbital disassembly, but we're a few years away yet. And
                        whilst on orbit chip replacement is much more mass efficient than replacing the
                        whole spacecraft, radiators and all, it's also a nontrivial undertaking

                    XorNot: And just like that you've added another not never done before, and
                    definitely not at scale problem to the mix.  These are all things which add
                    weight, complexity and cost.  Propellant transfer to an orbital Starship hasn't
                    even been done yet and that's completely vital to it's intended missions.

                    zeofig: "Planning" is a strong word..

                    mlyle: Another significant factor is that radiation makes things worse.
                    Ionizing radiation disrupts the crystalline structure of the semiconductor and
                    makes performance worse over time.  High energy protons randomly flip bits, can
                    cause latchup, single event gate rupture, destroy hardware immediately, etc.

                        Aerolfos: If anything, considering this + limited satellite lifetime, it almost
                        looks like a ploy to deal with the current issue of warehouses full of GPUs and
                        the questions about overbuild with just the currently actively installed GPUs
                        (which is a fraction of the total that Nvidia has promised to deliver within a
                        year or two).  Just shoot it into space where it's all inaccessible and will
                        burn out within 5 years, forcing a continuous replacement scheme and steady
                        contracts with Nvidia and the like to deliver the next generation at the exact
                        same scale, forever

                JumpCrisscross: > Everything about operating a datacenter in space is more
                difficult than it is to operate one on earth  Minus one big one: permitting.
                Every datacentre I know going up right now is spending 90% of their bullshit
                budget on battlig state and local governments.

                    deepGem: This is a huge one. What Musk is looking for is freedom from land
                    acquisition. Everything else is an engineering and physics problem that he will
                    somehow solve. The land acquisition problem is out of his hands and he doesn't
                    want to deal with politicians. He learned from building out the Memphis DC.

                        EdwardDiego: So freedom from law and regulation?

                        blactuary: He "learned" by illegally poisoning black people  > an engineering
                        and physics problem that he will somehow solve  no he won't

                        markhahn: Maybe, but I'm skeptical, because current DCs are not designed to
                        minimize footprint.  Has anyone even built a two-story DC?  Obviously cooling is
                        always an issue, but not, directly, land.  Now that I think of it, a big hydro
                        dam would be perfect: power and cooling in one place.

                            deepGem: Skepticism is valid. The environmentalists came after dams too.

                            mbushey: > Has anyone even built a two-story DC?  Downtown Los Angeles: The One
                            Wilshire building, which is the worlds most connected building. There are over
                            twenty floors of data centers. I used Corporate Colo which was a block or two
                            away. That building had at least 10 floors of Data Centers.

                                reverius42: I think Downtown Seattle has a bunch too (including near Amazon
                                campus). I just looked up one random one and they have about half the total
                                reported building square footage of a 10-story building used for a datacenter:

                            bigfatkitten: > Has anyone even built a two-story DC?  Every DC I’ve been in
                            (probably around 20 in total) has been multi storey.

                            lambdaone: Multistory DCs are commonplace in major cities.

                    dantillberg: But since building a datacenter almost anywhere on the planet is
                    more convenient than outer space, surely you can find some suitable
                    location/government. Or put it on a boat, which is still 100 times more sensible
                    than outer space.

                        JumpCrisscross: > since building a datacenter almost anywhere on the planet is

                        are regimes where this balances. I don't think we're there yet. But it's
                        irrational to reject it completely.  > Or put it on a boat, which is still 100

                            GCUMstlyHarmls: > More corrosion  Surely given starlinks 5ish year deorbit plan,
                            you could design a platform to hold up for that long... And instead of burning
                            the whole thing up you could just refurbish it when you swap out the actual rack
                            contents, considering that those probably have an even shorter edge lifespan.

                                m4rtink: Starlinks are built to safely burn up on re-entry. A big reusable
                                platform will have to work quite differently to never uncontrollably re-enter,
                                or it might kill someone by high velocity debris on impact.  This adds weight
                                and complexity and likely also forces a much higher orbit.

                                    necovek: Hopefully a sea platform does not end up flying into space all of its
                                    own, only to crash and burn back down.  Maybe the AI workloads running on it
                                    achieve escape velocity? ;)

                                    vlovich123: I can’t wait for all the heavy metals that are put into GPUs and
                                    other electronics showering down on us constantly. Wonder why the billionaires
                                    have their bunkers.

                                        reverius42: Yeah, "burn up safely on reentry".  100 years later: "why does
                                        everything taste like cadmium?"

                    sapphicsnail: What counts towards a bullshit budget? Permitting is a drop in the
                    bucket compared to construction costs.

                    floatrock: I mean, you don't have zoning in space, but you have things like
                    international agreements to avoid, you know, catastrophic human development
                    situations like kessler syndrome.  All satellites launched into orbit these days
                    are required to have de-orbiting capabilities to "clean up" after EOL.  I dunno,
                    two years ago I would have said municipal zoning probably ain't as hard to
                    ignore as international treaties, but who the hell knows these days.

                        small groups, days for large ones. (In America.)  Permitting is a legitimate
                        variable that weighs in favor of in-space data centers.

                        permitting costs. See 2.  2. Permits and approvals: Building permits,
                        environmental assessments, and utility connection fees add extra expenses. In
                        some jurisdictions, the approval process alone costs hundreds of thousands of
                        dollars. https://www.truelook.com/blog/data-center-construction-costs  3.
                        Assuming a 60MW facility at $10M/MW. See 4.  4. As a general rule, it costs
                        between $600 to $1,100 per gross square foot or $7 million to $12 million per
                        megawatt of commissioned IT load to build a data center. Therefore, if a
                        700,000-square foot, 60-megawatt data center were to be built in Northern
                        Virginia, the world’s largest data center market, it would cost between $420
                        million and $770 million to construct the facility, including its powered shell
                        and equipping the building with the appropriate electrical systems and HVAC

                            and attention costs, not saying that permits literally have a higher price tag
                            than GPUs.

                        financed two data centers. Most of my time was spent over permitting. If I
                        tracked it minute by minute, it may be 70 to 95%. But broadly speaking, if I had
                        to be told about it before it was solved, it was (a) a real nuisance and (b) not
                        technical.

                            as solar on the ground.

                        providing the demand for the huge Starship launch capacity.  A datacenter costs
                        ~$1000/ft^2. How much equipment per square foot is there? say 100kg (1 ton per
                        rack plus hallway). Which is $1000 to put into orbit on Starship at $100/kg. At
                        sub-$50/kg, you can put into orbit all the equipment plus solar panels and it
                        would still be cheaper than on the ground.

                            sense for Nvidia retail price but at cost price of Google.

                                trhway: Can only speculate out of thin air - B200 and Ryzen 9950x made on the
                                same process and have 11x difference in die size. 11 Ryzens would cost $6K, and
                                with 200Gb RAM - $8K. Googling brings that the B200 cost or production is $6400.
                                That  matches the numbers from the Ryzen based estimate above (Ryzen numbers is
                                retail, yet it has higher yield, so balance). So, i'd guess that given Google
                                scale a TPU similar to B200 should be $6K-$10K.

                        ericd: I think the disconnect is that with starship they’re targeting >200
                        tons/200,000 kg and $2m-$10m/launch, so the very optimistic case is more like
                        $10/kg. Also, the production of a panel in sun sync orbit is many times one on
                        the ground, doesn’t suffer seasonality/weather, and doesn’t require battery
                        storage for smoothing/time shifting, so you’d need to deploy many times the
                        number of panels on earth. Our home array in North America over the course of
                        the year generates something like 1/7th of its theoretical capacity,
                        overproduces in the summer, and underproduces in the winter.

                                The space shuttle having existed isn't an existence proof, given the cost of
                                repairs needed between missions.  However, with Starship SpaceX has both done
                                more and less than putting a banana in orbit. Less, because it's never once been
                                a true orbit; more, because these are learn-by-doing tests, all the reporting
                                seems to be in agreement that it could already deliver useful mass to orbit if
                                they wanted it to.  But without actually solving full reusability for the upper
                                stage, this doesn't really have legs. Starship is cheap enough to build they can
                                waste loads of them for this kind of testing, but not cheap enough for plans
                                such as these to make sense if they're disposable.

                    bildung: 1 KW of solar panels is 150€ retail right now. You are probably at 80€
                    or less if you buy a few MW.  (I'm ignoring installation costs etc. because
                    actually creating the satellites is ignored here, too)

                    dead dinosaurs we can burn. The efficiency gain is also more than offset by the
                    fact that you can't replace a worn out panel. A few years into the life of your
                    satellite its power production drops.

                        ignore the difficulty of getting them up there. I'd be interested to see a
                        comparison between the amount of energy required to get a solar panel into
                        space, and the amount of energy it produces during its lifetime there. I
                        wouldn't be surprised if it were a net negative; getting mass into orbit
                        requires a tremendous amount of energy, and putting it there with a rocket is
                        not an efficient process.

                            obidee2: My sketchy napkin math gives an order of magnitude of a few months of
                            panel output to get it in space.  5kg, 500W panel (don’t exactly know what the
                            ratio is for a panel plus protection and frame for space, might be a few times
                            better than this)  Say it produces about 350kWh per month before losses.  Mass
                            to LEO is something like 10x the weight in fuel alone, so that’s going to be
                            maybe 500kWh. Plus cryogenics etc.  So not actually that bad

                        serallak: If they plan to put this things in a low orbit their useful life
                        before reentry is low anyway.  A quick search gave me a lifespan of around 5
                        years for a starlink satellite.  If you put in orbit a steady stream of new
                        satellites every year maintenance is not an issue, you just stop using worn out
                        or broken ones.

                            kibwen: Terrestrial data centers save money and recoup costs by salvaging and
                            recycling components, so what you're saying here is that space-based datacenters
                            are even less competitive than we previously estimated.

                        ericd: No idea how quickly they wear out in space with 24x7 irradiance and space
                        temps, but on the earth, they’re at something like 80% capacity after 25 years.
                        So seems like you could control how long they have via overpanelling?

                    3eb7988a1663: Let's say with no atmosphere and no night cycle, a space solar
                    panel is 5x better. Deploying 5x as many solar panels on the ground is still
                    going to come in way under the budget of the space equivalent.

                        mike_hearn: That's with current launch costs, right? Nobody is claiming it's
                        economic without another huge fall in launch costs, but that's what SpaceX is
                        doing.

                            michaelmrose: It wouldn't make sense if launch was free and it will never be

                        cmenge: And it's not the same at all. 5x the solar panels on the ground means 5x
                        the power output in the day, still 0 at night. So you'd need batteries. If you
                        add in bad weather and winter, you may need battery capacity for days, weeks or
                        even months, shifting the cost to batteries while still relying on nuclear of
                        fossil backups in case your battery dies or some 3/4/5-sigma weather event
                        outside what you designed for occurs.

                            Certhas: Or you put the data centers at different points on earth?  Or you float
                            them on the ocean circumnavigating the earth?  Or we put the datacenters on

                                How is this a fantasy? With Starlink operational, this hardly seems a mere
                                'fantasy'.

                                    ndsipa_pomu: > You can't just shut off a data center at night.  Why not?  A
                                    capacity problem can be solved by having another data center the other side of
                                    the earth.  If it's that the power cycling causes equipment to fail earlier,
                                    then that can be addressed far more easily than radiation hardening all
                                    equipment so that it can function in space.

                                        ericd: Because GPUs are expensive, much more expensive than launch costs if they
                                        get starship to the low end of the range they’re aiming for, and you want your
                                        expensive equipment running as much as possible to amortize the cost down?

                    PunchyHamster: just take cost of getting kg in space and compare it to how much
                    solar panel will generate  Current satellites get around 150W/kg from solar
                    panels. Cost of launching 1kg to space is ~$2000. So we're at $13.3(3)/Watt. We
                    need to double it because same amount need to be dissipated so let's round it to
                    $27  One NVidia GB200 rack is ~120kW. To just power it, you need to send $3 240
                    000 worth of payload into space. Then you need to send additional $3 106 000
                    (rack of them is 1553kg) worth of servers. Plus some extra for piping

                        cmenge: Over 10 years ago, the best satellites had 500W/kg [2]. Modern solar
                        panels that are designed to be light are at 200g per sqm [1]. That's 5sqm per
                        kg. One sqm generates ca. 500W. So we're at 2.5kW per kg. Some people claim
                        4.3kW/kg possible.  Starship launch costs have a $100/kg goal, so we'd be at $40
                        / kW, or $4800 for a 120kW cluster.  120kW is 1GWh annually, costs you around
                        $130k in Europe per year to operate. ROI 14 days. Even if launch costs aren't
                        that low in the beginning and there's a lot more stuff to send up, your ROI
                        might be a year or so, which is still good.  [1] - https://www.polytechnique-

                            mkesper: What if you treat that launch costs goal as just a marketing promise.

                                billionaire's fantasies.  SpaceX has dramatically reduced payload cost already.
                                How is that a fantasy?

                smileeeee: The cost might be the draw (if there is one). Big tech isn't afraid
                of throwing money at problems, but the AI folk and financiers are afraid of
                waiting and uncertainty. A satellite is crazy expensive but throwing more money
                at it gets you more satellites.  At the end of the day I don't really care
                either way. It ain't my money, and their money isn't going to get back into the
                economy by sitting in a brokerage portfolio. To get them to spend money this is
                as good a way as any other, I guess. At least it helps fund a little spaceflight
                and satellite R&D on the way.

                    actionfromafar: It's just tax payer money, who cares right? :)

            tw04: Amazon’s new campus in Indiana is expected to use 2.2GW when complete.
            50Mw is nothing, and that’s ignoring the fact that most of that power wouldn't
            actually be used for compute.

            Aurornis: > Isn't 50MW already by itself equivalent to the energy consumption of
            a typical hyperscaler cloud?  xAI’s first data center buildout was in the 300MW
            range and their second is in the Gigawatt range. There are planned buildouts
            from other companies even bigger than that.  So data center buildouts in the AI
            era need 1-2 orders of magnitude more power and cooling than your 50MW estimate.
            Even a single NVL72 rack, just one rack, needs 120kW.

            hirsin: Simply put no, 50MW is not the typical hyperscaler cloud size. It's not
            even the typical single datacenter size.  A single AI rack consumes 60kW, and
            there is apparently a single DC that alone consumes 650MW.  When Microsoft puts
            in a DC, the machines are done in units of a "stamp", ie a couple racks
            together. These aren't scaled by dollar or sqft, but by the MW.  And on top of
            that... That's a bunch of satellites not even trying to crunch data at top
            speed. No where near the right order of magnitude.

                tensor: How much of that power is radiated as the radio waves it sends?

                    adgjlsfhk1: the majority is likely in radio waves and the inter satellite laser
                    communication

                        hdgvhicv: Inter sat comms cancels out - every kw sent by one sat is received by
                        another.

                            mlyle: It doesn't, because the beams are not so tight that they all fall on the
                            target satellite, and not all of that is absorbed :P

                    hirsin: Good point - the comms satellites are not even "keeping" some of the
                    energy, while a DC would. I _am_ now curious about the connection between
                    bandwidth and wattage, but I'm willing to bet that less than 1% of the total
                    energy dissipation on one of these DC satellites would be in the form of
                    satellite-to-earth broadcast (keeping in mind that s2s broadcast would
                    presumably be something of a wash).

                        adrian_b: I am willing to bet that more than 10% of the electrical energy
                        consumed by the satellite is converted into transmitted microwaves.  There must
                        be many power consumers in the satellite, e.g. radio receivers, lasers,
                        computers and motors, where the consumed energy eventually is converted into
                        heat, but the radio transmitter of a communication satellite must take a big
                        fraction of the average consumed power.  The radio transmitter itself has a
                        great efficiency, much greater than 50%, possibly greater than 90%, so only a
                        small fraction of the electrical power consumed by the transmitter is converted
                        into heat and most is radiated in the microwave signal that goes to Earth's
                        surface.

                            tullianus: Unfortunately this is not the case. The amplifiers on the transmit-
                            side phased arrays are about 10% efficient (perhaps 12% on a good day), but the
                            amps represent only ~half the power consumption of the transmit phased arrays.
                            The beamformers and processors are 0% efficient. The receive-side phased arrays
                            are of course 0% efficient as well.

                                klaff: I'm curious. I think the whole thing (space-based compute) is infeasible
                                and stupid for a bunch of reasons, but even a class-A amplifier has a
                                theoretical limit of 50% efficiency, and I thought we used class-C amplifiers
                                (with practical efficiencies above 50%) in FM/FSK/etc. applications in which
                                amplitude distortion can be filtered away. What makes these systems be down at
                                10%?

                                    adrian_b: Yes, a 10% efficiency is very weird if true.  Nowadays such microwave
                                    power amplifiers should be made with gallium nitride transistors, which should
                                    allow better efficiencies than the ancient amplifiers using LDMOS or travelling-
                                    wave tubes, and even those had efficiencies over 50%.  For beamformers, there
                                    have been research papers in recent years claiming a great reduction in losses,
                                    but presumably the Starlink satellites are still using some mature technology,
                                    with greater losses.

                    mlyle: I doubt half the power is to the transmitter, and radio efficiency is
                    poor -- 20% might be a good starting point.

                            radiators or insulators, as to regulate temperature. But I don't think it can
                            change the fundamental physics of radiating unwanted heat and that you can't do
                            better than black body radiation.

                                synctext: Indeed, graphene seems capable of .99 of black body radiation limit.
                                Quote: "emissivity higher than 0.99 over a wide range of wavelengths". Article
                                title "Perfect blackbody radiation from a graphene nanostructure" [1]. So
                                several rolls of 10 x 50 meters graphene-coated aluminium foil could have
                                significant cooling capability. No science-fiction needed anymore (see the 4km x

                                    habinero: It's not as exciting as you think it is. "emissivity higher than 0.99
                                    over a wide range of wavelengths" is basically code for "it's, like, super
                                    black"  The limiting factor isn't the emissivity, it's that you're having to
                                    rely on radiation as your only cooling mechanism. It's super slow and
                                    inefficient and it limits how much heat you can dissipate.  Like the other
                                    person said, you can't do any better than blackbody radiation (emissivity=1).

                                        adrian_b: Yes, graphene appears to offer a negligible improvement over other
                                        kinds of paints based on black carbon, e.g. Vantablack.  The research article
                                        linked above does not claim a better emissivity than Vantablack, but a
                                        resistance to higher temperatures, which is useful for high temperature sensors
                                        (used with pyrometers), but irrelevant for a satellite that will never be hotter
                                        than 100 Celsius degrees, in order to not damage the electronic equipment.

                                        DoctorOetker: Lets assume an electrical consumption of 1 MW which turned into
                                        heat and a concommitant 3 MW which was a byproduct of acquiring 1 MW of
                                        electrical energy.  So the total heat load if 4 MW (of which 1 MW was
                                        temporarily electrical energy before it was used by the datacenter or whatever).
                                        Let's assume a single planar radiator, with emissivity ~1 over the thermal
                                        infrared range.  Let's assume the target temperature of the radiator is 300 K
                                        (~27 deg C).  What size radiator did you need?  4 MW / (5.67 * 10 ^ -8 W / ( m
                                        ^2 K ^4 ) * 300 K ^4) = 8710 m ^2 = (94 m) ^2  so basically 100m x 100m. Thats
                                        not insanely large.  The solar panels would have to be about 3000 m ^2 = 55m x
                                        55m  The radiator could be aluminum foil, and something amounting to a remote
                                        controlled toy car could drive around with a small roll of aluminum wire and
                                        locally weld shut small holes due to micrometeorites. the wheels are rubberized
                                        but have a magnetic rim, on the outside theres complementary steel spheres so
                                        the radiator foil is sandwiched between wheel and steel sphere. Then the wheels
                                        have traction. The radiator could easily weigh less than the solar panels, and
                                        expand to much larger areas. Better divide the entire radiator up into a few
                                        inflatable surfaces, so that you can activate a spare while a sever leak is
                                        being solved.  It may be more elegant to have rovers on both inside and outside
                                        of the radiator: the inner one can drop a heat resistant silicone rubber disc /
                                        sheet over the hole, while the outside rover could do the welding of the hole
                                        without obstruction of the hole by a stopgap measure.

                                            mlyle: > The radiator could be aluminum foil,  As I've pointed it out to you
                                            elsewhere -- how do you couple the 4MW of heat to the aluminum foil?  You need
                                            to spread the power somewhat evenly over this massive surface area.  Low
                                            pressure gas doesn't convect heat well and heat doesn't conduct down the foil
                                            well.  It's just like how on Earth we can't cool datacenters by hoping that free
                                            convection will transfer heat to the outer walls.

                                                DoctorOetker: Lets assume you truly believe the difficulty is the heat
                                                transport, then you correct me, but I never see you correct people who believe
                                                the thermal radiation step is the issue. It's a very selective form of
                                                correcting.  Lets assume you truly believe the difficulty is the heat transport
                                                to the radiator, how is it solved on earth?

                                                    mlyle: > Lets assume you truly believe the difficulty is the heat transport,

                                                    radiation step is the issue  It's both.  You have to spread a lot of heat very
                                                    evenly over a very large surface area.  This makes a big, high-mass structure.
                                                    > how is it solved on earth?  We pump fluids (including air) around to move
                                                    large amounts of heat both on Earth and in space.  The problem is, in space, you
                                                    need to pump them much further and cover larger areas, because they only way the
                                                    heat leaves the system is radiation.  As a result, you end up proposing a system
                                                    that is larger than the cooling tower for many nuclear power plants on Earth to
                                                    move 1/5th of the energy.  The problem is, pumping fluids in space around has 3
                                                    ways it sucks compared to Earth:  1. Managing fluids in space is a pain.  2. We
                                                    have to pump fluids much longer distances to cover the large area of radiators.
                                                    So the systems tend to get orders of magnitude physically larger.  In practice,
                                                    this means we need to pump a lot more fluid, too, to keep a larger thing close
                                                    to isothermal.  3. The mass of fluids and all their hardware matters more in
                                                    space.  Even if launch gets cheaper, this will still be true compared to Earth.
                                                    I explained this all to you 15 hours ago:  > If this wasn't a concern, you could
                                                    fly a big inflated-and-then-rigidized structure and getting lots of area
                                                    wouldn't be scary. But since you need to think about circulating fluids and
                                                    actively conducting heat this is much less pleasant.  You may notice that the
                                                    areas, etc, we come up with here to reject 70kW are similar to those of the
                                                    ISS's EATCS, which rejects 70kW using white-colored radiators and ammonia loops.
                                                    Despite the use of a lot of exotic and expensive techniques to reduce mass, the
                                                    radiators mass about 10 tonnes-- and this doesn't count all the hardware to
                                                    drive heat to them on the other end.  So, to reject 105W on Earth, I spend about
                                                    500g of mass; if I'm as efficient as EATCS, it would be about 15000g of mass.

                                    adrian_b: Aluminum foil of great surface will not work very well, because the
                                    limited conductivity of a thin foil will create a great temperature gradient
                                    through it.  Thus the extremities of the foil, which are far from the satellite
                                    body, will be much cooler than the body, so they will have negligible
                                    contribution to the radiated power.  The ideal heatsink has fins that are thick
                                    close to the body and they become thinner towards extremities, but a heatsink
                                    made for radiation instead of convection needs a different shape, to avoid a
                                    part of it shadowing other parts.  I do not believe that you can make an
                                    efficient radiation heatsink with metallic foil. You can increase the radiating
                                    surface by not having a flat surface, but one covered with long fins or cones or
                                    pyramids, but the more the surface is increased, the greater the thermal
                                    resistance between base and tip becomes, and also the tips limit the solid angle
                                    through which the bases radiate, so there must be some optimum shape that has
                                    only a limited surface increasing factor over the radiation of a flat body.

                                        metallic foil.  What radiators look like is foil or sheet covering fluid loops
                                        to spread the heat, control the color, and add surface area.  In general,
                                        radiators are white because there's no reason for them to absorb visible light,
                                        and they're not hot enough to radiate visible light.  You want them to be
                                        reflective in the visible spectrum (and strongly absorptive/emissive in the
                                        infrared).  A white surface pointing at the sun can be quite cool in LEO, <
                                        -40C.

                                    mlyle: What radiators look like is foil or sheet covering fluid loops to spread
                                    the heat, control the color, and add surface area.  They are usually white,
                                    because things in a spacecraft are not hot enough to glow in visible light and
                                    you'd rather they not get super hot if the sun shines on them.  The practical
                                    emittance of both black paint and white paint are very close to the same at any
                                    reasonable temperature-- and both are quite good, >90% of this magical material
                                    that you cite ;)  Better materials -- with less visible absorption and more
                                    infrared emittance -- can make a difference, but you still need to convect or
                                    conduct the heat to them, and heat doesn't move very well in thin materials as
                                    my sibling comment says.  The graphene radiator you cite is more about active
                                    thermal control than being super black.  Cheap ways to change how much heat you
                                    are dumping are very useful for space missions that use variable amounts of
                                    power or have very long eclipse periods, or what move from geospace to deep
                                    space, etc.  Usually you solve it on bigger satellites with louvers that change
                                    what color they're exposing to the outside, but those are mechanical parts and
                                    annoying.

                        PunchyHamster: Entirely depends on band, at 10GHz more like 40%, at lower
                        frequencies more, for example FM band can even go to 70%

                    nosianu: The radio receiver and transmitter are additional hardware and energy
                    consumption. They add to the heat, not subtract from it.

                        jeltz: I think you missed the point. If you have a 100 MW communicstion
                        satellite and a 100 MW compute satellite those are very different beasts. The
                        first might send 50% of the energy away as radio communication making it
                        effectively a 50 MW satellitefor cooling purposes.

                            habinero: No, they didn't. You can't "send away" thermal energy via radio waves.
                            At the temperatures we're talking about, thermal energy is in the infrared.
                            That's blackbody radiation.

                                mortehu: Your answer makes it seem like you too missed the point. If a Starlink
                                sends a 1000W signal to Earth, that is 1000W of power that does not heat the
                                satellite.

                                adrian_b: You missed the point.  Nobody describes a satellite by specifying the
                                amount of heat that it produces, but by the amount of electrical energy that it
                                consumes.  In a communication satellite, a large fraction of the consumed
                                electrical energy goes into the radio transmitter. Radio transmitters are very
                                efficient and most of the consumed power is emitted as radio waves and only a
                                very small part is converted into heat, which must be handled by the cooling
                                system.  So in any communication satellite, a significant fraction of the
                                consumed energy does not become heat.

                moment for hyperscalers is somewhere around ~150kW, can someone confirm?  The
                energy demand of these DCs is monstrous, I seriously can't imagine something
                similar being deployed in orbit...

                    synctext: Could this be about bypassing government regulation and taxation?
                    Silkroad only needed a tiny server, not 150kW.  The Outer Space Treaty (1967)
                    has a loophole. If you launch from international waters (planned by SpaceX) and
                    the equipment is not owned by a US-company or other legal entity there is
                    significant legal ambiguity. This is Dogecoin with AI. Exploiting this
                    accountability gap and creating a Grok AI plus free-speech platform in space
                    sounds like a typical Elon endeavour.

                        habinero: No. There is no "one weird trick" when it comes to regulation. The
                        company is based in the US, therefore you just go after that.  Anyway, promising
                        some fantasy and never delivering is definitely a typical Elon endeavor.

                        jacquesm: You misspelled 'hate speech'.

                        9dev: Untrue. Responsible for any spacefaring vessel is in all cases the state
                        the entity operating the vessel is registered in. If it's not SpaceX directly
                        but a shell company in Ecuador carrying out the launch, Ecuador will be
                        completely responsible for anything happening with and around the vessel,
                        period. There are no loopholes in this system.

                        Someone: For the sake of an argument, let’s assume "The Outer Space Treaty
                        (1967) has a loophole. If you launch from international waters (planned by
                        SpaceX) and the equipment is not owned by a US-company or other legal entity
                        there is significant legal ambiguity” is 100% true.  To use that loophole, the
                        rockets launched by SpaceX would have to be “not owned by a US-company”. Do you
                        think the US government would allow that to happen?

                        inglor_cz: You cannot escape national regulations like that, at least until a
                        maritime-like situation develops, where rockets will be registered in Liberia
                        for a few dollars and Liberia will not even pretend to care what they are doing.
                        It may happen one day, but we are very, very far from that. As of now, big
                        countries watch their space corporations very closely and won't let them do
                        this.  Nevertheless, as an American, you can escape state and regional
                        authorities this way. IIRC The Californian Coastal Commission voted against
                        expansion of SpaceX activities from Vandenberg [1], and even in Texas, which is
                        more SpaceX-friendly, there are still regulations to comply with.  If you launch
                        from international waters, these lower authority tiers do not apply.  [1]

                        zbentley: In addition to all the sibling comments explaining why this wouldn't
                        work, the money's not there.  A grift the size of Dogecoin, or the size of "free
                        speech" enthusiast computing, or even the size of the criminal enterprises that
                        run on the dark web, is tiny in comparison to the footer cost and upkeep of a
                        datacenter in space. It'd also need to be funded by investments (since criminal
                        funds and crypto assets are quite famously not available in up-front volumes for
                        a huge enterprise), which implies a market presence in some country's economy,
                        which implies regulators and risk management, and so on.

                        Schlagbohrer: This could simply be done by hosting in the Tor hidden service
                        cloud. Accessing illegal material hosted on a satellite is still exactly as
                        risky for the user (if the user is on earth) as accessing that same illegal
                        material through the Tor network, but hosting it through the Tor network can be
                        done for 1/1000th the cost compared to an orbital solution.  So there's no
                        regulatory or tax benefit to hosting in space.

                    stonogo: Most of the OEMs are past 300kW racks, planning on 600kW racks within a
                    year or two, with realistic plans to hit a megawatt

                mike_hearn: But the focus on building giant monolithic datacenters comes from
                the practicalities of ground based construction. There are huge overheads
                involved with obtaining permits, grid connections, leveling land, pouring
                concrete foundations, building roads and increasingly often now, building a
                power plant on site. So it makes sense to amortize these overheads by building
                massive facilities, which is why they get so big.  That doesn't mean you need a
                gigawatt of power before achieving anything useful. For training, maybe, but not
                for inference which scales horizontally.  With satellites you need an orbital
                slot and launch time, and I honestly don't know how hard it is to get those, but
                space is pretty big and the only reasons for denying them would be safety. Once
                those are obtained done you can make satellite inferencing cubes in a factory
                and just keep launching them on a cadence.  I also strongly suspect, given some
                background reading, that radiator tech is very far from optimized. Most stuff we
                put into space so far just doesn't have big cooling needs, so there wasn't a
                market for advanced space radiator tech. If now there is, there's probably a lot
                of low hanging fruit (droplet radiators maybe).

                    cogman10: > I also strongly suspect, given some background reading, that

                    just doesn't have big cooling needs, so there wasn't a market for advanced space

                    (droplet radiators maybe).  You'd be wrong.  There's a huge incentive to
                    optimized radiator tech because of things like the international space station
                    and MIR.  It's a huge part of the deployment due to life having pretty narrow
                    thermal bands.  The added cost to deploy that tech also incentivizes hyper
                    optimization.  Making bigger structures doesn't make that problem easier.  Fun
                    fact, heat pipes were invented by NASA in the 60s to help address this very
                    problem.

                        mike_hearn: The ISS is a government project that's heading towards EOL, it has
                        no incentive to heavily optimize anything because the people who built it don't
                        get rich by doing so. SpaceX is what optimization looks like, not the ISS.

                            jeltz: By the same token SpaceX has no reason to optimize Starship. That is also
                            largely a government project.

                                b112: It's a private company, is profit motivated, and thus has reason to
                                optimize.  That was the parent poster's point.  Starship isn't largely a
                                government project.  It was planned a decade before the government was ever
                                involved, they came along later and said "Hey, this even more incredible launch
                                platform you're building?  Maybe we can hire SpaceX to launch some things with
                                it?"  Realistically, SpaceX launches far more payload than any government.

                                    habinero: Haha no. SpaceX survives entirely on money from the US government.
                                    It's always been that way.

                                        thinkcontext: A puzzling statement, could you explain? Most of their revenue now
                                        comes Starlink which is mostly private clients. Also it's trivial to look at
                                        their launch history and see they have plenty of private clients. For sure the
                                        USG is their most important client but "entirely" is flat out wrong.

                                        s-y: Where are you getting this from?

                                        lightedman: Entirely? lol not even close.  Source: I am out of LEDs and LASERs
                                        and now handle aerospace solar for a private company. Guess who almost everyone
                                        in the private sector flies on?

                                    oivey: Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon, and all the others are private
                                    companies, too. NASA and others generally go through contractors to build
                                    things. SpaceX is on the dole just like them.

                                pineaux: that is true. They would have failed after their first failed launch.
                                The US government saved them.

                            cogman10: > has no incentive to heavily optimize anything because the people who
                            built it don't get rich by doing so.  Optimization is literally how contractors
                            working for the government got rich.  Every hour they spent on research was
                            directly billed to the government.  Weight reduction being one of the most
                            important and consistent points of research.  Heck, R&D is how some of the
                            biggest government contractors make all their dough.  SpaceX is built on the
                            billions in research NASA has invested over the decades.  It looks like it's
                            more innovative simply because the USG decided to nearly completely defund
                            public spending in favor of spending money on private contractors like SpaceX.
                            That's been happening since the 90s.

                        zero_bias: ISS and MIR combined are not a "large market". How many radiators
                        they require? Probably a single space dc will demand a whole orders of magnitude
                        more cooling

                            cogman10: ISS cost $150B and a large factor driving that cost was the payload
                            weight.  Minimizing payload at any point was easily worth a billion dollars.
                            And given how heavy and nessisary the radiators are (look them up), you can bet
                            a decent bit of research was invested in making them lightweight.  Heck, one bit
                            of research that lasted the entire lifetime of the shuttle was improving the
                            radiative heat system [1].  Multiple contractors and agencies invested a huge
                            amount of money to make that system better.  Removing heat is one of the most
                            researched problems of all space programs.  They all have to do it, and every
                            gram of reduction means big savings.  Simply saying "well a DC will need more of
                            it, therefore there must be low hanging fruit" is naive.  [1]

                    leoedin: But why would you?  Space has some huge downsides:  * Everything is
                    being irradiated all the time. Things need to be radiation hardened or shielded.
                    * Putting even 1kg into space takes vast amounts of energy. A Falcon 9 burns 260
                    MJ of fuel per kg into LEO. I imagine the embodied energy in the disposable
                    rocket and liquid oxygen make the total number 2-3x that at least.  * Cooling is
                    a nightmare. The side of the satellite in the sun is very hot, while the side
                    facing space is incredibly cold. No fans or heat sinks - all the heat has to be
                    conducted from the electronics and radiated into space.  * Orbit keeping
                    requires continuous effort. You need some sort of hypergolic rocket, which has
                    the nasty effect of coating all your stuff in horrible corrosive chemicals  *
                    You can't fix anything. Even a tiny failure means writing off the entire system.
                    * Everything has to be able to operate in a vacuum. No electrolytic capacitors
                    for you!  So I guess the question is - why bother? The only benefit I can think
                    of is very short "days" and "nights" - so you don't need as much solar or as big
                    a battery to power the thing. But that benefit is surely outweighed by the fact
                    you have to blast it all into space? Why not just overbuild the solar and
                    batteries on earth?

                        Findeton: Maybe they should try to build it in the moon. Difficult, but perhaps
                        not as difficult?

                            thephyber: Almost none of the parent’s bullet points are solved by building on
                            the Moon instead of in Earth orbit.  The energy demands of getting to the 240k
                            mile Moon are IMMENSE compared to 100 mile orbit.  Ultimately, when comparing
                            the 3 general locations, Earth is still BY FAR the most hospitable and
                            affordable location until some manufacturing innovations drop costs by orders of
                            magnitude. But those manufacturing improvements have to be made in the same
                            jurisdiction that SpaceXAI is trying to avoid building data centers in.  This
                            whole things screams a solution in search of a problem. We have to solve the
                            traditional data center issues (power supply, temperature, hazard resilience,
                            etc) wherever the data centers are, whether on the ground or in space. None of
                            these are solved for the theoretical space data centers, but they are all
                            already solved for terrestrial data centers.

                                ethbr1: In situ iron, titanium, aluminum?

                                    notahacker: That's a hard problem to solve. Invest enough in solving that
                                    problem and you might get the ability to manufacture a radiator out of it, but
                                    you're still going to have to transport the majority of your datacenter to the
                                    moon. That probably works out more expensive than launching the whole thing to
                                    LEO

                                    mcny: But none of those are usable, right? It will take decades of work at least
                                    to get a commercial grade mining operation going and even then the iron,
                                    titanium, aluminum would need to be fashioned...  Ah, I see the idea now. It is
                                    to get people to talk about robotics and how robots will be able to do all this
                                    on the moon or wherever.  Instantly pumps Tesla stock here now on earth!

                            ahoka: It has all these problems, plus more.

                            kakacik: Yeah, carrying stuff 380k km and still deploying in vacuum (and super
                            dusty ground) doesn't solve anything but adds cost and overhead. One day maybe,
                            but not these next decades nor probably this century.

                            nkrisc: Sounds more difficult. Not only is the moon further, you also need to
                            use more fuel to land on it and you also have fine, abrasive dust to deal with.
                            There’s no wind of course, but surely material will be stirred up and resettle
                            based on all the landing activity.  And it’s still a vacuum with many of the
                            same cooling issues. I suppose one upside is you could use the moon itself as a
                            heat sink (maybe).

                                microtherion: > Not only is the moon further, you also need to use more fuel to
                                land on it  And take off again, if reusable spacecraft are meant to be used.

                            sdenton4: The 2.5s round trip communication latency isn't going to be great for
                            chat. (Alongside all the other reasons.)

                                zbentley: And 2.5s is best case. Signal strength issues, antenna alignment
                                issues, and all sorts of unknown unknowns conspire to make high-integrity/high-
                                throughput digital signal transmissions from a moon-based compute system have a
                                latency much worse than that on average.

                            AllegedAlec: Still a vacuum so the same heat dissipation issues, adding to it
                            that the lunar dust makes solar panels less usable, and the lunar surface on the

                            wookmaster: Why does that make sense at all

                                JeremyNT: > Why does that make sense at all  Parent said it would make more
                                sense.  I guess in terms of the relative level of stupidity on display, it would
                                be slightly less stupid to build huge reflectors in space than it is to try to
                                build space datacenters, where the electricity can only power specific pieces of
                                equipment that are virtually impossible to maintain (and are typically obsolete
                                within a few years).

                        fpoling: If one kilogram of stuff consumes just 100Wt, then in one month it
                        consumes about 300 MJ. So as long as things works for a year or more energy cost
                        to put them into orbit becomes irrelevant.  To keep things in orbit ion
                        thrusters work nicely and require just inert gases to keep them functioning.
                        Plus on a low Earth orbit there are suggestions that a ramjet that capture few
                        atoms of atmosphere and accelerates them could work.  Radiative cooling scales
                        by 4th power temperature. So if one can  design electronics to run at, say, 100
                        C, then calling would be much less problematic.  But radiation is the real
                        problem. Dealing with that would require entirely different architecture/design.

                        inglor_cz: "But why would you?"  Because the permitting process is much easier
                        and there are way, way fewer authorities that can potentially shut you down.  I
                        think this is the entire difference. Space is very, very lightly regulated,
                        especially when it comes to labor, construction and environmental law. You need
                        to be able to launch from somewhere and you need to automate a lot of things.
                        But once you can do this, you escaped all but a few authorities that would hold
                        power over you down on Earth.  No one will be able to complain that your data
                        center is taking their water or making their electricity more expensive, for
                        example.

                            oivey: The satellite is built on Earth, so I’m not sure how it dodges any of
                            those regulations practically. Why not just build a fully autonomous, solar
                            powered datacenter on Earth? I guess in space Elon might think that no one can
                            ban Grok for distributing CSAM?  There’s some truly magical thinking behind the
                            idea that government regulations have somehow made it cheaper to launch a rocket
                            than build a building. Rockets are fantastically expensive even with the major
                            leaps SpaceX made and will be even with Starship. Everything about a space
                            launch is expensive, dangerous, and highly regulated. Your datacenter on Earth
                            can’t go boom.

                                inglor_cz: "fantastically expensive"  From individual POV yes, but already
                                Falcons are not that expensive. In the sense that it is feasible for a
                                relatively unimportant entity to buy their launch services.  "The satellite is
                                built on Earth, so I’m not sure how it dodges any of those regulations
                                practically."  It is easier to shop for jurisdiction when it comes to
                                manufacturing, especially if your design is simple enough - which it has to be
                                in order to run unattended for years. If you outsource the manufacturing to N
                                chosen factories in different locations, you can always respond to local
                                pressure by moving out of that particular country. In effect, you just rent time
                                and services of a factory that can produce tons of other products.  A data
                                center is much more expensive to build and move around. Once you build it in
                                some location, you are committed quite seriously to staying there.

                                mike_hearn: Truly magical thinking, you say? OK, let's rewind the clock to 2008.
                                In that year two things happened:  - SpaceX launched its first rocket
                                successfully.  - California voted to build high speed rail.  Eighteen years
                                later:  - SpaceX has taken over the space industry with reusable rockets and a
                                global satcom network, which by itself contains more than half of all satellites
                                in orbit.  - Californian HSR has spent over thirteen billion dollars  and laid
                                zero miles of track. That's more than 2x the cost of the Starship programme so
                                far.  Building stuff on Earth can be difficult. People live there, they have
                                opinions and power. Their governments can be dysfunctional. Trains are 19th
                                century technology, it should be easier to build a railway than a global
                                satellite network. It may seem truly magical but putting things into orbit can,
                                apparently, be easier.

                                    msie: it should be easier to build a railway  No, because of the costs of
                                    acquiring land that the railway goes through.

                                        ericd: Now how about procuring half a gigawatt when nearby residents are annoyed
                                        about their heating bills doubling, and are highly motivated to block you? This
                                        is already happening in some areas.

                        elihu: The main reason is that generating energy in space is very cheap and easy
                        due to how ridiculously effective solar panels are.  Someone mentioned in the
                        comments on a similar article that sun synchronous orbits are a thing.  This was
                        a new one to me.  Apparently there's a trick that takes advantage of the Earth
                        not being a perfect sphere to cause an orbit to precess at the right rate that
                        it matches the Earth's orbit around the sun.  So, you can put a satellite into a
                        low-Earth orbit that has continuous sunlight.
                        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit  Is this worth all the cost
                        and complexity of lobbing a bunch of data centers into orbit?  I have no idea.
                        If electricity costs are what's dominating the datacenter costs that AI
                        companies are currently paying, then I'm willing to at least concede that it
                        might be plausible.  If I were being asked to invest in this scheme, I would
                        want to hear a convincing argument why just deploying more solar panels and
                        batteries on Earth to get cheap power isn't a better solution.  But since it's
                        not my money, then if Elon is convinced that this is a great idea then he's
                        welcome to prove that he (or more importantly, the people who work for him) have
                        actually got this figured out.

                            leoedin: Let's assume your space solar panel is always in sun - so 8760 kWh per
                            year from 1kWp.  In Spain, 1kWp of solar can expect to generate about 1800 kWh
                            per year. There's a complication because seasonal difference is quite large - if
                            we assume worst case generation (ie what happens in December), we get more like
                            65% of that, or 1170 kWh per year.  That means we need to overbuild our solar
                            generation by about 7.5x to get the same amount of generation per year. Or
                            7.5kWp.  We then need some storage, because that generation shuts off at night.
                            In December in Madrid the shortest day is about 9 hours, so we need 15 hours of
                            storage. Assuming a 1kW load, that means 15kWh.  European wholesale solar panels
                            are about €0.1/W - €100/kW. So our 7.5kWp is €750. A conservative estimate for
                            batteries is €100/kWh. So our 15kWh is €1500. There's obviously other costs -
                            inverters etc. But perhaps the total hardware cost is €3k for 1kW of off-grid
                            solar.  A communications satellite like the Eurostar Neo satellite has a payload
                            power of 22 kW and a launch mass of 4,500 kg. Assuming that's a reasonable
                            assumption, that means about 204kg per kW. Current SpaceX launch costs are circa
                            $1500 per kg - but they're targeting $100/kg or lower. That would give a launch
                            cost of between $300k and $20k per kW of satellite power. That doesn't include
                            the actual cost of the satellite itself - just the launch.  I just don't see how
                            it will make sense for a long time. Even if SpaceX manage to drastically lower
                            launch costs. Battery and solar costs have also been plummeting.

                                mike_hearn: Thanks for the interesting calculations.  Is it reasonable to use
                                Neo as a baseline? Modern Starlink satellites can weigh 800kg, or less than 20%
                                of Neo. I see discussions suggesting they generate ~73kw for that mass. I guess
                                because they aren't trying to blanket an entire continent in signal? Or, why are
                                they so much more efficient than Neo?  Interestingly the idea of doing compute
                                in space isn't a new one, it came up a few years ago pre-ChatGPT amongst people
                                discussing the v2 satellite:
                                https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=58374.msg2...  Still, you make
                                good points. Even if you assume much lighter satellites, the GPUs alone are very
                                heavy. 700kg or so for a rack. Just the payload would be as heavy as the entire
                                Starlink satellite.

                            blastro: Kind of a scary thought - a DC in space can't be stopped by protests or
                            regulation

                                elihu: That could be one reason they want to do it.  Maybe by using data from
                                Palantir or harvested from Elon's work with DOGE, along with twitter user data
                                and whatever else they can get, they want their AI to be the all-seeing eye of
                                Sauron.  (Which isn't too far from what the whole ad-tech industry is about in
                                the first place.)  Or they want to make sexually explicit deepfakes of everyone
                                Elon doesn't like.  Or they want to flood the internet with AI generated right-
                                wing propaganda.

                    thephyber: There is a lot of hand waiving away of the orders of magnitude more
                    manufacturing, more launches, and more satellites that have to navigate around
                    each other.  We still don’t have any plan I’ve heard of for avoiding a cascade
                    of space debris when satellites collide and turn into lots of fast moving
                    shrapnel. Yes, space is big, but low Earth orbit is a very tiny subset of all
                    space.  The amount of propulsion satellites have before they become unable to
                    maneuver is relatively small and the more satellite traffic there is, the faster
                    each satellite will exhaust their propulsion gasses.

                        Elon probably said "they could just run the machines faster! I'm brilliant".

                        What do you mean we don’t have any plans to avoid that? It is a super well
                        studied topic of satelite management. Full books have been written on the topic.
                        Here is just one:
                        https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230002470/downloads/CA...  Did you think
                        satelites are kept apart by good luck and providence?

                            thephyber: I am very aware that the US Air Force / Space Force monitor’s
                            trajectories and calls satellite owners when there is an anticipated collision
                            but that method doesn’t scale, especially with orders of magnitude more
                            satellites in the same LEO shells.  And it still doesn’t solve the problem of a
                            cascade causing shrapnel density to increase in an orbit shell which then causes
                            satellites to use some of their scarce maneuver budget to avoid collision. But
                            as soon as a satellite exhausts that budget, it becomes fodder for the shrapnel
                            cascade.

                    skywhopper: All of those “huge overheads” you cite are nothing compared to the
                    huge overhead of building and fueling rockets to launch the vibration- and
                    radiation-hardened versions of the solar panels and GPUs and cooling equipment
                    that you could use much cheaper versions of on Earth. How many permitted,
                    regulated launches would it take to get around the one-time permitting and
                    predictable regulation of a ground-based datacenter?  Are Earth-based
                    datacenters actually bound by some bottleneck that space-based datacenters would
                    not be? Grid connections or on-site power plants take time to build, yes. How
                    long does it take to build the rocket fleet required to launch a space
                    “datacenter” in a reasonable time window?  This is not a problem that needs to
                    be solved. Certainly not worth investing billions in, and definitely not when
                    run by the biggest scam artist of the 21st century.

            markhahn: 50MW is on the small side for an AI cluster - probably less than 50k
            gpus.  if the current satellite model dissipates 5kW, you can't just add a GPU
            (+1kW).  maybe removing most of the downlink stuff lets you put in 2 GPUs?  so
            if you had 10k of these, you'd have a pretty high-latency cluster of 20k GPUs.
            I'm not saying I'd turn down free access to it, but it's also very cracked.  you
            know, sort of Howard Hughesy.

                hackernudes: High latency to earth but low latency (potentially) to other
                satellites.

            javascriptfan69: Starlink provides a service that couldn't exist without the
            satellite infrastructure.  Datacenters already exist. Putting datacenters in
            space does not offer any new capabilities.

                _fizz_buzz_: This is the main point I think. I am very much convinced that
                SpaceX is capbable to put a datacenter into space. I am not convinced they can
                do it cheaper than building a datacenter on earth.

                    notahacker: I would be a lot more convinced they had found a way to solve the
                    unit economics if it was being used to secure billion dollar deposits from other
                    companies rather than as the narrative for rolling a couple of Elon's loss
                    making companies into SpaceX and IPOing...

            adgjlsfhk1: > A Starlink satellite uses about 5K Watts of solar power. It needs
            to dissipate around that amount (+ the sun power on it) just to operate.  This
            isn't quite true. It's very possible that the majority of that power is going
            into the antennas/lasers which technically means that the energy is being
            dissipated, but it never became heat in the first place. Also, 5KW solar power
            likely only means ~3kw of actual electrical consumption (you will over-provision
            a bit both for when you're behind the earth and also just for safety margin).

            gclawes: Starlink satellites also radiate a non-trivial amount of the energy
            they consume from their phased arrays

            antonvs: > Why is starlink possible and other computations are not?  Aside from
            the point others have made that 50 MW is small in the context of hyperscalers,
            if you want to do things like SOTA LLM training, you can't feasibly do it with
            large numbers of small devices.  Density is key because of latency - you need
            the nodes to be in close physical proximity to communicate with each other at
            very high speeds.  For training an LLM, you're ideally going to want individual
            satellites with power delivery on the order of at least about 20 MW, and that's
            just for training previous-generation SOTA models. That's nearly 5,000 times
            more power than a single current Starlink satellite, and nearly 300 times that
            of the ISS.  You'd need radiator areas in the range of tens of thousands of
            square meters to handle that. Is it theoretically technically possible? Sure.
            But it's a long-term project, the kind of thing that Musk will say takes "5
            years" that will actually take many decades. And making it economically viable
            is another story - the OP article points out other issues with that, such as
            handling hardware upgrades. Starlink's current model relies on many cheap
            satellites - the equation changes when each one is going to be very, very
            expensive, large, and difficult to deploy.

            kristjansson: 50MW might be one aisle of a really dense DC.  A single rack might
            draw 120kW.

            pdpi: 5kW means you can't even handle a single one of these[0], compared to a
            handful per rack on an earthbound data centre.  0.

            MadnessASAP: I ran the math the last time this topic camps up  The short answer
            is that ~100m2 of steel plate at 1400C (just below its melting point) will shed
            50MW of power in black body radiation.
            https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46087616#46093316

                ViewTrick1002: Which GPU runs at 1400C?

                    MadnessASAP: One made of steel presumably.  I would assume such a setup involves
                    multiple stages of heat pumps to from GPU to 1400C radiatoe. Obviously that's
                    going to impact efficiency.  Also I'm not seriously suggesting that 1400C
                    radiators is a reasonable approach to cooling a space data centre. It's just
                    intended to demonstrate how infeasible the idea is.

                        adrian_b: The idea of using heat pumps to increase the temperature of the
                        radiator is unlikely to allow an increase of the fraction of the original amount
                        of heat that is radiated per heatsink surface, i.e. the added heat may be higher
                        than the additionally radiated heat, though I am too lazy to compute now whether
                        this is possible.  Moreover, a heat pump would add an equipment with moving
                        parts that can fail, requiring maintenance.

                adrian_b: The temperature of space datacenters will be limited to 100 Celsius
                degrees, because otherwise the electronic equipment will be destroyed.  So your
                huge metal plate would radiate (1673/374)^4 = 400 times less heat, i.e. only 125
                kW.  In reality, it would radiate much less than that, even if made of copper or
                silver covered with Vantablack, because the limited thermal conductivity will
                reduce the temperature for the parts distant from the body.

            phs318u: Because 10K satellites have a FAR greater combined surface area than a
            single space-borne DC would. Stefan-Boltzman law: ability to radiate heat
            increase to the 4th power of surface area.

                thebolt00: It's linear to surface area, but 4th power to temperature.

                    dguest: Also worth noting that if computing power scales with volume then
                    surface area (and thus radiation) scales like p^2/3. In other words, for a fixed
                    geometry, the required heat dissipation per unit area goes like p^1/3. This is
                    why smaller things can just dissipate heat from their surface, whereas larger
                    things require active cooling.  I'm not a space engineer but I'd imagine that
                    smaller satellites can make due with a lot of passive cooling on the exterior of
                    the housing, whereas a shopping-mall sized computer in space would will require
                    a lot of extra plumbing.

                    phs318u: Thanks for the correction. Last time I looked at it was in 2nd year
                    Thermodynamics in 1985.

            padjo: Are starlink satellites in sun synchronous orbits? Doesn't constant solar
            heating change the energy balance quite a bit?

            cjfd: Sure, we can run the math on heat dissipation. The law of Stefan-Boltzman
            is free and open source and it application is high school level physics. You
            talk about 50 MW. You are going to need a lot of surface area to radiate that
            off at somewhere close to reasonable temperatures.

                ndsipa_pomu: > The law of Stefan-Boltzman is free and open source... What do you
                mean by "open source"?  Can we contribute changes to it?

            PurpleRamen: A Starlink satellite is mainly just receiving and sending data, the
            bare minimum of a data center-satellite's abilities; everything else comes on
            top and would be the real power drain.

            Sharlin: Square–cube law.

            michaelmrose: Why would anyone think the unit cost would be competitive with
            cheap power / land on earth? If that doesn't make sense how could anything else?

            chairmansteve: A typical desktop/tower PC will consume 400 watts. So 12 PC's
            equals 1 starlink satellite.  A single server in a data center will consume 5-10
            kW.

            kimixa: Output from radiating heat scales with area it can dissipate from. Lots
            of small satellites have a much higher ratio than fewer larger satellites.
            Cooling 10k separate objects is orders of magnitude easier than 10 objects at
            1000x the power use, even if the total power output is the same.  Distributing
            useful work over so many small objects is a very hard problem, and not even
            shown to be possible at useful scales for many of the things AI datacenters are
            doing today. And that's with direct cables - using wireless communication means
            even less bandwidth between nodes, more noise as the number of nodes grows, and
            significantly higher power use and complexity for the communication in the first
            place.  Building data centres in the middle of the sahara desert is still much
            better in pretty much every metric than in space, be it price, performance,
            maintainance, efficiency, ease of cooling, pollution/"trash" disposal etc. Even
            things like communication network connectivity would be easier, as at the
            amounts of money this constellation mesh would cost you could lay new fibre
            optic cables to build an entire new global network to anywhere on earth and have
            new trunk connections to every major hub.  There are advantages to being in
            space - normally around increased visibility for wireless signals, allowing
            great distances to be covered at (relatively) low bandwidth. But that comes at
            an extreme cost. Paying that cost for a use case that simply doesn't get much
            advantages from those benefits is nonsense.

                    May i remind you it will be in the shadow of earth for half a year.

                        adrianN: A tanker full of LNG and a turbine would probably work.

                            multiplegeorges: Kinda like the ones they are already burning in Starship to put
                            these in space in the first place.  Anywhere on earth is better than space for
                            this application.

                        idontwantthis: Space is so expensive that you can power it pretty much any way
                        you want and it will be cheaper. Nuclear reactor, LNG, batteries (truck them in
                        and out if you have to). Hell, space based solar and beam it down. Why would
                        there ever be an advantage to putting the compute in space?

                            cmsj: Get those penguins doing something productive for once, put them on

                                to accomplish something on earth, is vastly cheaper, easier, and faster than
                                doing it in space.

                        sandworm101: Then you put another in the high north.  Two, or six, is still
                        cheaper than one in orbit.

                        plant?

                    kimixa: Yup - my example of the Sahara wasn't really a specific suggestion, so
                    much as an example of "The Most Inconvenient Inhospitable part of the earth's
                    surface is still much better than space for these use cases". This isn't star
                    trek, the world doesn't match sci-fi.  It's like his "Mars Colony" junk - and
                    people lap it up, keeping him in the news (in a not explicitly negative light -
                    unlike some recent stories....)

                abalone: > using wireless communication means even less bandwidth between nodes,
                more noise as the number of nodes grows, and significantly higher power use
                Space changes this. Laser based optical links offer bandwidth of 100 - 1000 Gbps
                with much lower power consumption than radio based links. They are more feasible
                in orbit due to the lack of interference and fogging.  > Building data centres
                in the middle of the sahara desert is still much better in pretty much every
                metric  This is not true for the power generation aspect (which is the main
                motivation for orbital TPUs). Desert solar is a hard problem due to the need for
                a water supply to keep the panels clear of dust. Also the cooling problem is
                greatly exacerbated.

                    Retric: You don’t need to do anything to keep panels with a significant angle
                    clear of dust in deserts.  The Sahara is near the equator but you can stow
                    panels at night and let the wind do its thing.  The lack of launch costs more
                    than offset the need for extra panels and batteries.

                        abalone: What’s your source for that claim? Soiling is a massive problem for
                        desert solar, causing as high as 50% efficiency loss in the Middle East.[1]  [1]
                        https://www.nlr.gov/news/detail/features/2021/scientists-stu...

                            Retric: A relevant quote from that article.  “The reason I concentrate my
                            research on these urban environments is because the composition of soiling is
                            completely different,” said Toth, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental engineering
                            at the University of Colorado who has worked at NREL since 2017. “We have more
                            fine particles that are these stickier particles that could contribute to much
                            different surface chemistry on the module and different soiling. In the desert,
                            you don’t have as much of the surface chemistry come into play.”

                                abalone: You’re not summarizing the article fairly. She is saying the soiling
                                mechanisms are environmentally dependent, not that there is no soiling in the
                                desert. Again, it cites an efficiency hit of 50% in the ME. The article later
                                notes that they’ve experimented with autonomous robots for daily panel cleaning,
                                but it’s not a generally solved problem and it’s not true that “the wind takes
                                care of it.”  And you still haven’t provided a source for your claim.

                    cmsj: Space doesn't really change it though because the effective bandwidth
                    between nodes is reduced by the overall size of the network and how much data
                    they need to relay between each other.

                        kimixa: Yup. We don't use fibre optics on earth rather than lasers because of
                        some specific limitation of the earth's surface being in orbit would avoid.  We
                        use them because they're many orders of magnitude cheaper and simpler for
                        anywhere near the same bandwidth for the distances required.

                ineedasername: Why would they bother to build space data center in such
                monolithic massive structures at all? Direct cables between semi-independent
                units the size of a star link v2 satellite. That satellite size is large enough
                to encompass a typical 42U server rack even without much physical
                reconfiguration. It doesn't need to be "warehouse sized building, but in space",
                and neither does it have to be countless objects kilometers apart from each
                other beaming data wirelessly. A few dozen wired as a cluster is much more than
                sufficient to avoid incurring any more bandwidth penalties on server-to-server
                communication with correlated work loads than we already have on earth for most
                needs.  Of course this doesn't solve the myriad problems, but it does put
                dissipation squarely in the category of "we've solved similar problems". I agree
                there's still no good reason to actually do this unless there's a use for all
                that compute out there in orbit, but that too is happening with immense growth
                and demand expected for increased pharmaceutical research and various
                manufacturing capabilities that require low/no gravity.

                    bigbuppo: Not just a 42U rack, but a 42U rack that needs one hundred thousand
                    watts of power, and it also needs to be able to remove one hundred thousand
                    watts of heat out of the rack, and then it needs to dump that one hundred
                    thousand watts of heat into space.

            ErroneousBosh: > A Starlink satellite uses about 5K Watts of solar power  Is
            that 5kW of electrical power input at the terminals, or 5kW irradiation onto the
            panels?  Because that sounds like kind of a lot, for something the size of a
            fridge.

            rootnod3: Forget heat. Replacing disks alone is a deal breaker on that one.

            jdhwosnhw: > A Starlink satellite uses about 5K Watts of solar power. It needs
            to dissipate around that amount (+ the sun power on it) just to operate.  The “+
            solar power” part is the majority of the energy. Solar panel efficiency is only
            about 25-30% at beginning-of-life whereas typical albedos are effectively 100%.
            So your estimate is off by at least a factor of three.  Also, I’m not sure where
            you got 5 kw from. The area of the satellite is ~100 m2, which means they are
            intercepting over 100 kw of bolometric solar power.

            whiplash451: Not related to heat, but a com satellite is built from extremely
            durable HW/SW that's been battle-tested to run flawlessly over years with
            massive MTBF numbers.  A data center is nowhere near that and requires constant
            physical interventions. How do they suggest to address this?

                    endlessly promote Gemini (ala Chrome), their R&D capabilities around AI, their
                    own chips, crazy access to training data, and so on - they'd have to pull the
                    ultimate goof to mess up here.  Microsoft is toast, short of a miracle. I'd bet
                    against Office and Windows here. As Office goes down, it's going to take Windows
                    down with it. The great Office moat is about to end. The company struggles, the
                    stock struggles, Azure gets spun off (unlock value, institutional pressure),
                    Office + Windows get spun off - the company splits into pieces. The LLMs are an
                    inflection point for Office and Microsoft is super at risk, backwards regarding
                    AI and they're slow. The OpenAI pursuit as it was done, was a gigantic mistake
                    for Microsoft - one of the dumbest strategies in the history of tech, it left
                    them with their pants down. Altman may have killed a king by getting him to be
                    complacent.  Grok is very unlikely to make it (as is). The merger with SpaceX
                    guarantees its death as a competitor to GPT/Gemini/Claude, it's over. Maybe
                    they'll turn Grok into something useful to SpaceX. More likely they'll slip
                    behind and it'll die rapidly like Llama. The merger is because they see the
                    writing on the wall, this is a bailout to the investors (not named Elon) of xAI,
                    as the forced Twitter rollup was a bailout for the investors of Twitter.  Claude
                    is in a weird spot. What they have is not worth $300-$500 billion. Can they
                    figure out how to build a lot more value out of what they have today (and get
                    their finances sustainable), before the clock runs out? Or do they get purchased
                    by Meta, Microsoft, etc.  OpenAI has to rapidly roll out the advertising model
                    and get the burn rate down to meaningless levels, so they're no longer dependent
                    on capital markets for financing (that party is going to end suddenly).  Meta is
                    permanently on the outside looking in. They will never field an in-house
                    competitor to GPT or Gemini that can persistently keep up. Meta doesn't know
                    what it is or why it should be trying to compete with GPT/Gemini/Claude. Their
                    failure (at this) is already guaranteed. They should just acquire GPT 4o and let
                    their aging userbase on FB endlessly talk itself into the grave for the next 30
                    years while clicking ads.  If Amazon knew what they were doing (they don't right
                    now), they would: immediately split retail + ads and AWS. The ad business
                    ensures that the retail business will continue to thrive and would be highly
                    lucrative. Then have AWS purchase Anthropic when valuations drop, bolt it on to
                    AWS everything. Far less of an anti-trust issue than if what is presently known
                    as Amazon attempted it here and now. Anthropic needs to build a lot on to itself
                    to sustain itself and justify its valuation, AWS already has the answer to that.
                    If valuations plunge, and OpenAI is not yet sustainable, Microsoft should split
                    itself into pieces and have the Windows-Office division purchase OpenAI as their
                    AI option. It'd be their only path to avoiding anti-trust blocking that
                    acquisition. As is Microsoft would not be allowed to buy OpenAI. Alternatively
                    Microsoft can take a shot at acquiring Anthropic at some point - this seems
                    likely given the internal usage going on at Redmond, the primary question is
                    anti-trust (but in this case, Anthropic is viewed as the #3, so Microsoft would
                    argue it bolsters competition with GPT & Gemini).

                        convinced on this TBH in the long-run. Google is seemingly a pure play
                        technology firm that has to make products for the sake of it, else the
                        technology is not accessible/usable. Does that mean they are at their core a
                        product firm? Nah. Thats always been Apple's core thing, along side superior
                        marketing.  One only has to compare Google's marketing of the Pixel phone to
                        Apple - it does not come close. Nobody connects with Google's ads, the way they
                        do with Apple. Google has a mountain to climb and has to compensate the user
                        tremendously for switching.  Apple will watch the developments keenly and figure
                        out where they can take advantage of the investments others have made. Hence the
                        partnerships et al with Google.

                        postexitus: Why do you say Amazon doesn't know what they are doing? I think
                        among those mentioned, they are the best positioned alongside Apple in the
                        grander schema of things.  Also you say meta will never field a competitor to
                        GPT - but they did llama; not as a commercial product, but probably an attempt
                        at it (and failed). Otherwise agreed.

                        arppacket: *Altman may have killed a king by getting him to be complacent.*  I
                        still think a lot about the failed OpenAI coup, and how different things would
                        be now if Microsoft hadn't backed Altman. Would this hype cycle and bubble grown
                        so ridiculous if there were more conscientious people in charge at the front-
                        runner? We will unfortunately never know. I really wish that board had planned
                        out their coup better.

                    o333: The answer to this is very very simple.  Think about the stock return over
                    a period - its composed of capital gains and dividends.  Now what happens
                    capital gains disappears and perhaps turns into capital losses? Dividends have
                    to go higher.  What does this mean? Less retained earnings / cashflows that can
                    be re-invested.  Apple is the only one that will come out of this OK. The others
                    will be destroyed for if they dont return cash, the cash balance will be
                    discounted leading to a further reduction in the value of equity. The same thing
                    that happened to Zuckerberg and Meta with the Metaverse fiasco.  Firms in the
                    private sphere will go bust/acquired.

                        JumpCrisscross: > Now what happens capital gains disappears and perhaps turns
                        into capital losses? Dividends have to go higher  This is not how corporate
                        finance works. Capital gains and losses apply to assets. And only the most
                        disciplined companies boost dividends in the face of decline—most double down
                        and try to spend their way back to greatness.

                TurdF3rguson: Merging with SpaceX means they don't have to pay for their
                existence. Anyway they're probably positioned better than any other AI player
                except maybe Gemini.

                    ericmay: I don’t follow why merging with SpaceX means they don’t have to pay for
                    their existence. Someone does. Presumably now that is SpaceX. What is SpaceX’s
                    revenue?

                        reverius42: Maybe the idea is that SpaceX has access to effectively unlimited
                        money through the US Government, either via ongoing lucrative contracts, or
                        likely bailouts if needed. The US Govt wouldn't bail out xAI but they would bail
                        out SpaceX if they are in financial trouble.

                            arppacket: Bingo! Elon's main life mission now is to roll back social progress
                            via the anti-woke combination of xAI and Twitter. That's why he's tying them to
                            the now rather-essential SpaceX, despite possibly hurting its IPO. He can now
                            keep pumping money into them without a worry.

            mbesto: Arena rankings, lol.  Openrouter is a decent proxy for real world use

                    mbesto: They sure are right to criticize but not by this specific evidence:

        stogot: xAI includes twitter? I thought twitter was just X?

            7bees: xAI acquired twitter in 2025 as part of Musk's financial shell game
            (probably the same game he is playing with SpaceX/xAI now).

        chairmansteve: Elon's always looking for another Brooklyn Bridge to sell to the
        rubes...

        Vaslo: Sounds like Elon hurt someone’s feelings

    strangeloops85: The energy economics in space are also a bit more complicated
    than usually thought. I think Starlink has been using Si cells instead of III-V-
    based ones, but in addition to lower output they also tend to degrade faster
    under radiation. I guess that's ok if the GPU is going to be toast in a few
    years anyway so you might as well de-orbit the whole thing. But that same solar
    cell on Earth will happily be producing for 40+ years.  Also the same issue with
    radiative cooling pops up for space solar cells - they tend to run way hotter
    than on Earth and that lowers their efficiency relative to what you could get
    terrestrially.

    s0a: quantum computers on the sun!

    tbrownaw: > I would not assume cooling has been worked out.  There should be
    some temperature where incoming radiation (sunlight) balances outgoing radiation
    (thermal IR). As long as you're ok with whatever that temperature is at our
    distance from the sun, I'd think the only real issue would be making sure your
    satellite has enough thermal conductivity.

    bunderbunder: My guess is it’s just another example of his habit of trying to
    use one of his companies to manufacture demand for another  of his companies’
    products.  Specifically: Starship makes no economic sense. There simply isn’t
    any pre-existing demand for the kind of heavy lift capacity and cadence that
    Starship is designed to deliver. Nor is there anyone who isn’t currently
    launching heavy payloads to LEO but the only thing holding them back is that
    they need weekly launches because their use case demands a whole lot of heavy
    stuff in space on a tight schedule and that’s an all-or-nothing thing for them.
    So nobody else has a reason to buy 50 Starship launches per year. And the
    planned Starlink satellites are already mostly in orbit. So what do you do? Just
    sell Starship to xAI, the same way he fixed Cybertruck’s demand problem by
    selling heaps of them to SpaceX.

        drivebyhooting: There might be a lot of induced demand from starship.  I’m sure
        defense is a big one.

            bunderbunder: No, but really, where will it come from?  If (as seems to be the
            case) nobody can identify a specific source of latent demand that is large
            enough to soak up the two order of magnitude increase in the supply of heavy
            lift launch capacity that Elon wants to deliver, then that strongly suggests
            that SpaceX does not actually have a business plan for Starship. Or at least,
            not a business plan that’s been thought through as clearly as a $5 billion (and
            counting) investment would warrant.  “Defense” is not nearly specific enough to
            count as an answer. What kind of defense application, specifically, do you have
            in mind, and why does it need specifically this kind of heavy lift capacity to
            be viable?

        weregiraffe: >Specifically: Starship makes no economic sense.  Starship can
        replace Falcon 9 and probably be cheaper, if fully reusable, so more profitable.
        So at least some economic sense is there already.

            kibwen: No, that's not how any of this works. Try to think for a moment why we
            still overwhelmingly use non-jumbo jets for aviation in a world where jumbo jets
            exist.

                bunderbunder: Not to mention that making the upper stage and payload fairing
                much bigger and heavier juat so you can recover them is not an automatic win.
                You can recover it, but you’ve also made it much more expensive in the first
                place. And the booster needs to be bigger, heavier and more expensive, too.
                It’s not an automatic deal breaker, of course. Falcon 9 is obviously a promising
                success. But Starship is also working with some new challenges that Falcon 9
                didn’t have to worry about.  Many of these stem from design compromises that
                were forced by Starship’s secondary goal of being capable of a trip to Mars. In
                that respect, it very much resembles another major project to produce a heavy
                launch vehicle with a reusable combination payload fairing and upper stage that
                is also capable of carrying a human crew: the Space Shuttle.

            bunderbunder: I have noticed that there are two radically different approaches
            to assessing Starship.  One is based on boring old analysis, hard numbers, and,
            worst of all, continually updating the analysis as more information (e.g.,
            Raptor’s severe expectations vs reality shortfall) becomes available.  People
            who use this approach don’t seem to have an opinion of Starship that is trending
            upward.  The other approach seems to be based on vibes, and trusting that
            Starship will meet its original design goals despite the fact that no rocket
            project has ever come close to such an achievement. If there’s ever any
            introspection about why Starship should be the exceptional project that actually
            does meet its performance goals, the conclusion tends to be something about how
            Starship is special because it’s being developed by a private company. And I’ve
            noticed that, if the conversation does get to this point, you can send it in all
            sorts of unpredictable and fascinating directions by saying words like “OTRAG”
            and “Conestoga.”

    simoncion: > I would not assume cooling has been worked out.  That's wise.
    However, TFA's purpose in assuming cooling (and other difficulties) have been
    worked out (even though they most definitely have not) was to talk about other
    things that make orbital datacenters in space economically dubious. As
    mentioned:    But even if we stipulate that radiation, cooling, latency, and
    launch costs are all solved, other fundamental issues still make orbital data
    centers, at least as SpaceX understands them, a complete fantasy. Three in
    particular come to mind:

    a-dub: apocalyptic space twitter with satellites shaped like whales that drop
    from the sky would have been cooler.

    pokot0: Can’t you heat exchange inside the satellite, and make one part of the
    satellite incredibly hot so that it radiates a lot and dissipates.  This is just
    a question. I have no expertise at all with this.

        TrainedMonkey: Good intuition, that is generally how radiators work in space.

        prpl: yeah if you want a heat thruster

        thinkingkong: You definitely _can_ the question is, can you do it by enough for
        a reasonable amount of money. There are a few techniques to this but at the end
        of the day you need to radiate away, the heat otherwise it will just keep
        growing. You cannot keep pumping energy into the satellite without distributing
        the same amount back out again.

        pas: Yes, but you need energy to pump heat, and that has an efficiency maximum
        (thx ~~Obama~~ Carnot), and radiative cooling scales with the ~4th power of the
        temperature, so it has to be really hot, and so it requires a lot of energy to
        "cool down" the already relatively cool side and use that "heat" to heat up the
        other side that's a thousand degree hotter.  All in all, the cooling system
        would likely consume more energy than the compute parts.

        parl_match: yes. it is how sats currently handle this. its actually
        exponentially effective too P = E S A T^4  requires a lot of weight (cooling
        fluid). requires a lot of materials science (dont want to burn out radiator).
        requires a lot of moving parts (sun shutters if your orbit ever faces the sun -
        radiator is going to be both ways).  so that sounds all well and good (wow! 4th
        power efficiency!) but it's still insanely expensive and if your radiator
        solution fucks up in any way (in famously easy to service environment space)
        then your entire investment is toast  now i havent run the math on cost or what
        elon thinks the cost is, but my extremely favorable back of hand math suggests
        he's full of it

            godelski: Be careful with the math there. While a 4th power is awesome you got
            the Stefan-Boltzman constant to consider and that's on the order of 10^-8
            Radiative power is really efficient for hot things but not so great when you're
            trying to keep things down to normal levels. Efficient for shedding heat from a
            sun but not so much for keeping a cpu from overheating...

            FabHK: Pet peeve:  T^4 is not exponential in T, it’s polynomial. For
            exponential, T must be in the exponent, e.g. 2^T or so.  Still, pretty
            effective.  Having said that, agree that Elon is full of it.

                parl_match: yes sorry, it's a fourth order exponent but not exponential

        rcruzeiro: You can. This is how it is currently done, but it is not easy.  It
        needs to have a large enough surface area to radiate the heat, and also be
        protected from the sun (as to not collect extra heat). For a data centre, think
        of an at least 1000m2 heat exchange panel (likely more to train a frontier
        model).

        kamaal: >>This is just a question. I have no expertise at all with this.  On the
        similar lines, why can't one run a refrigerator in space?

            jdranczewski: You can, but the heat needs to go somewhere, and now you're back
            to square one, with "how do I get rid of all this heat". Earth refrigerators
            have a large heat exchanger on the back for this purpose. In fact now you need
            to get rid of both of the heat your compute generates and the energy your
            refrigerator pump uses - an example people often give is that a fridge with an
            open door actually heats the room, as it spends energy on moving heat around
            pointlessly.

        afiori: Sure but if it was a good idea we could do it on earth too and
        datacenters could stop gurgling a city worth of water

    mlindner: I want to nitpick you here but a thermos is specifically good at
    insulating because not only does it have a vacuum gap, it's also got two layers
    of metal (inner and outer) to absorb and reflect thermal radiation.  That
    specific aspect is NOT true in space because there's nothing stopping thermal
    radiation.  Now you're correct that you can't remove heat by conduction or
    convection in space, but it's not that hard to radiate away energy in space. In
    fact rocket engine nozzle extensions of rocket upper stages depend on thermal
    radiation to avoid melting. They glow cherry red and emit a lot of energy.  By
    Stefan–Boltzmann law, thermal radiation goes up with temperature to the 4th
    power. If you use a coolant that lets your radiator glow you can conduct heat
    away very efficiently. This is generally problematic to do on Earth because of
    the danger of such a thing and also because such heat would cause significant
    chemical reactions of the radiator with our corrosive oxygen atmosphere.  Even
    without making them super hot, there's already significant energy density on
    SpaceX's satellites. They're at around 75 kW of energy generation that needs to
    be radiated away.  And on your final statement, hyperloop was not used as a
    "distraction" as he never even funded it. He had been talking about it for years
    and years until fanboys on twitter finally talked him into releasing that
    hastily put together white paper. The various hyperloop companies out there
    never had any investment from him.

        runarberg: It is well known that Musk primary reason to push Hyperloop was
        because he didn’t want them to build a high speed rail for some reason:  > Musk
        admitted to his biographer Ashlee Vance that Hyperloop was all about trying to
        get legislators to cancel plans for high-speed rail in California—even though he
        had no plans to build it.  https://time.com/6203815/elon-musk-flaws-billionaire-
        visions...

        kuschku: > a thermos is specifically good at insulating because not only does it
        have a vacuum gap, it's also got two layers of metal (inner and outer) to absorb
        and reflect thermal radiation.  Not necessarily. There are many modern thermos
        "cups" that are just a regular cup, except with two layers of glass and a
        vacuum. Even the top is open all the time. (e.g.
        https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/passerad-double-wall-glass-8054... )  It's still
        good enough to keep your coffee hot for an entire day.

    JumpCrisscross: > It could be a legal dodge. It could be a power grab. What it
    will not be is a useful source of computing power  It's a way to get cheap
    capital to get cool tech. (Personal opinion.)  Like dark fibre in the 1990s,
    there will absolutely–someday–be a need for liquid-droplet radiators [1]. Nobody
    is funding it today. But if you stick a GPU on one end, maybe they will let you
    build a space station.  [1]

    bdangubic: musk is always up to something but remarkably people still eat this
    stuff up - remarkable to watch!

    matt-p: (DTC) Datacentres take electricity and turn it into low grade heat e.g
    60c water. Put them anywhere where you've either got excess (cheap) energy or
    where you can use the heat. Either is fine, both is great, but neither is both
    bad and current standard practice.  It's perfectly possible to put small data
    centres in city centres and pipe the heat around town, they take up very very
    little space and if you're consuming the heat, you don't need the noisy cooling
    towers (Ok maybe a little in summer).  Similarly if you stick your datacentre
    right next to a big nuclear power plant, nobody is even going to notice let
    alone care.

        MengerSponge: Resistive heating is a tremendously inefficient way to generate
        heat. Sometimes it's worth it if you get something useful in exchange (such as
        full spectrum light in the winter). But it's not all upsides.  Heat pumps are
        magic. They're something like 300% efficient. Each watt generates 3 watts of
        useful heat.

            lambertsimnel: I share your enthusiasm about heat pumps, but I wonder what the
            efficiency of using waste heat is. Couldn't it be competitive with heat pumps?
            As it's a waste product, isn't it reasonable to also expect it to be more than
            100% efficient?

                CorrectHorseBat: Much more than 100% since the only energy you need to put in is
                for pumping the hot water around.

                matt-p: As a rule of thumb (obviously it varies) you spend about 1% pumping
                water round a heat network. So your CoP is around 99 if you consider heat truly
                free. It's actually higher as pump energy largely is converted to friction/heat.

                Nevermark: You can’t extract energy from heat by itself. Only from a heat delta.
                Think of heat like flowing water or charge. Only an altitude or voltage delta
                creates the flow needed to harvest energy.  You get no useful energy from heat
                you are already trying to shed because you have no delta to work with. (The
                entire problem exists because there is no surrounding environment with high heat
                capacity and lower heat.)

                    CorrectHorseBat: What is waste heat depends on your usecase. Using waste heat
                    from industrial processes for district heating is done in some places.

                        Nevermark: Yes, because there is a heat delta. A heat difference.  Using higher
                        heat to raise lower heat is just the most simple case.  But purpose isn't
                        relevant to this constraint, it is a physics constraint. Regardless of purpose,
                        you can't extract useful energy from heat without a heat difference to work
                        with. (And without a heat difference, even "heating" with heat doesn't do
                        anything.)

                            CorrectHorseBat: Yes you can, that is exactly what heat pumps do. As long as the
                            total entropy increases it is not in violation of the laws of thermodynamics.
                            But I don't really see how that is relevant to the question of using waste
                            energy to heat homes. We don't have ideal Carnot machines so there's always
                            energy wasted, which most of the time is still good enough for residential
                            heating.

            HDThoreaun: Its not inefficient if you were creating the heat anyway, its a
            completely free byproduct.

                matt-p: Yeah. This. Obviously if the objective is just to generate heat only buy
                a heat pump and not a B200!

        elil17: Well a few considerations:  - You have to size your cooling towers for
        your hottest hour. Doing this saves you no capital costs.  - You barely have to
        run the fans on your cooling towers in the winter because the air is so cold. So
        often this also won’t save you much operating costs.  - Already there is an
        essentially unlimited amount of so called “waste heat” from power plants and
        factories. Building district heating systems is extremely capital intensive,
        which is why this isn’t done more.  - As a municipality it’s just a horrible
        idea to make the heating system of your whole city rely on a random company
        continuing to operate (even worse if said company is in a potential bubble).
        This is why most district heating systems work with power plants - they already
        have the government involved in ensuring their continuing operations.

            matt-p: I don't think I ever said it reduced capital cost. I agree (though you
            might be willing to take more risk on reducing redundancy e.g instead of 2+1
            cooling towers you may be more willing to just buy 2).  You cannot put a power
            station in the middle of a city centre, you can put a datacentre there. The main
            reason this isn't done more is that it's expensive to build heat network between
            the 'far out of town industrial area' where they put the heat sources and the
            city centre where the heat consumers are.  I don't know why a municipality is
            involved, but regardless you can simply install a backup heat source  and/or add
            a mix of heat suppliers to the network. Backup gas boiler or similar is not that
            problematic or expensive to add particularly because you don't need to add
            redundancy as it's just there for a backup scenario.

    jimt1234: > It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.
    Please, no!

    phendrenad2: I think people underestimate how quickly heat radiates to space. A
    rock in orbit around Earth will experience 250F/125C on the side facing the Sun,
    and -173C/-280F on the other side. The ability to rotate an insulating shield
    toward the sun means you're always radiating.

        pclmulqdq: I think you may be overestimating how quickly this happens and
        underestimating how much surface area that rock has. Given no atmosphere, the
        fact that the rock with 1/4 the radius of Earth has a temperature differential
        of only 300C between the hot side and the cold side, there's not a lot of
        radiation happening.  In deep space (no incident power) you need roughly 2000 sq
        meters of surface area per megawatt if you want to keep it at 40C. That would
        mean your 100 MW deep space datacenter (a small datacenter by AI standards)
        needs 200000 sq meters of surface area to dissipate your heat. That is a flat
        panel that has a side length of 300 meters (you radiate on both sides).
        Unfortunately, you also need to get that power from the sun, and that will take
        a square with a 500 meter side length. That solar panel is only about 30%
        efficient, so it needs a heatsink for the 70% of incident power that becomes
        heat. That heatsink is another radiator. It turns out, we need to radiate a
        total of ~350 MW of heat to compute with 100 MW, giving a total heatsink side
        length of a bit under 600 meters.  All in, separate from the computers and
        assuming no losses from there, you need a 500x500 meter solar panel and a
        600x600 meter radiator just for power and heat management on a relatively small
        compute cluster.  This sounds small compared to things built on Earth, but it's
        huge compared to anything that has been sent to space before. The ISS is about
        100 meters across and about 30 meters wide for comparison.

            phendrenad2: > 2000 sq meters of surface area per megawatt if you want to keep
            it at 40C  What is this figure based on?

            ralfd: > it's huge compared to anything that has been sent to space before  That
            is the goal of Starship though. The ISS has a mass of 400 ton, the goal is to
            need only two cheap launches of Starship v4 for that.

            FabHK: First, thanks for your knowledgeable input.  Second, are you saying that
            we basically need to have a radiator as big (approximately) as the solar panels?
            That is a lot, but it does sound manageable, in the sense that it approximately
            doubles what we require anyway for power.  So, not saying that it’s easy or
            feasible, but saying that cooling then seems “just” as difficult as power, not
            insurmountably more difficult. (Note that the article lists cooling, radiation,
            latency, and launch costs as known hard problems, but not power.)

                pclmulqdq: > So, not saying that it’s easy or feasible, but saying that cooling
                then seems “just” as difficult as power, not insurmountably more difficult  This
                is with an ideal radiator and perfect pointing so it receives no incident light,
                so in practice you need a bigger one than this.  However, if you think launching
                a solar panel that is the size of 10 NYC city blocks is "manageable," then why
                not throw in a radiator that is about 15 city blocks in size?

            mike_hearn: What do you think about droplet radiators? E.g. using a ferrofluid
            with magnetic containment for capture and enough spare on board to last five
            years of loss due to occasional splashes?

    rpcope1: I think it's possibly more informative to look at what happened with
    SolarCity and Tesla and contemplate if there's not a similar dynamic here.

    BobbyTables2: It’s funny how quickly the general public forgot about the “vacuum
    thermos”.  (Perhaps more popular before StarBucks overran society).  Those
    flasks don’t have any space age insulating material - mainly just a vacuum…
    Technology from 1892…

        mytailorisrich: They are more popular than ever, actually. Pretty much all those
        fancy cups and bottles (like Stanley, other brands available) sold to keep your
        coffee hot/drink cold on the go are vaccum ones. It's just updated and more
        robust design compared to the older thermos flasks.

    bartread: All of this and more.  For example: quite apart from the fact of how
    much rocket fuel is it going to take to haul all this shit up there at the kind
    of scale that would make these space data centres even remotely worthwhile.  I'm
    not against space travel or space exploration, or putting useful satellites in
    orbit, or the advancement of science or anything like that - quite the opposite
    in fact, I love all this stuff. But it has to be for something that matters.
    Not for some deranged billionaire's boondoggle that makes no sense. I am so
    inexpressibly tired of all these guys and their stupid, arrogant, high-handed
    schemes.  Because rocket fuels are extremely toxic and the environmental impact
    of pointlessly burning a vast quantity of rocket fuel for something as
    nonsensical as data centres in space will be appalling.

        energy123: Does that emit more than Elon's terrestrial data centers powered by
        natural gas, per unit of compute?

        ianburrell: Starship is fueled with methane (natural gas) and liquid oxygen
        which aren't toxic. It does produce a lot of CO2 which is a problem with lots of
        flights.

            afiori: IIRC the methane is produced at launch site with considerable pollution

    sam: This is mistaken. In space a radiator can radiate to cold (2.7K) deep
    space. A thermos on earth cannot. The temperature difference between the inner
    and outer walls of the thermos is much lower and it’s the temperature difference
    which determines the rate of cooling.

        pclmulqdq: "Radiate" is exactly what you have to do, and that is extremely slow.
        You need a huge area to dissipate the amount of power you are talking about.

            fnordpiglet: Basically you concentrate the heat into a high emissivity high
            temperature material that’s facing deep space and is shaded. Radiators get
            dramatically smaller as temperature goes up because radiation scales as T⁴
            (Stefan–Boltzmann).  There are many cases in space where you need to radiate
            heat - see Kerbal Space Program

                pclmulqdq: "High emissivity, high temperature" sounds good on paper, but to
                create that temperature gradient within your spacecraft the way you want costs a
                lot of energy. What you actually do is add a shit load of surface area to your
                spacecraft, give that whole thing a coating that improves its emissivity, and
                try your hardest to minimize the thermal gradient from the heat source (the hot
                part) throughout the radiator. Emissivity isn't going past 1 in that equation,
                and you're going to have a very hard time getting your radiator to be hotter
                than your heat source.  Note that KSP is a game that fictionalizes a lot of
                things, and sizes of solar panels and radiators are one of those things.

        WalterBright: I have a vacuum thermos. I've been unimpressed with its ability to
        keep coffee hot.

    notepad0x90: You're thinking of outer space. At any distance away from earth
    where space is so thin that heat dissipation is impossible, then the speed of
    light will be prohibitive of any workloads to/from space. there is plenty of
    altitude above the karman line where there is enough atmosphere to dissipate
    heat. Furthermore, i don't know if they figured it out, but radiation can
    dissipate heat, that's how we get heat from the sun. Also, given enough input
    energy (the sun), active closed-cooling systems might be feasible.
    https://www.nasa.gov/smallsat-institute/sst-soa/thermal-cont...  But I really
    hope posts like this don't discourage whoever is investing in this. The problems
    are solvable, and someone is trying to solve them, that's all that matters. My
    only concern is the latency, but starlink seems to manage somehow.  Also, a
    matter of technicality (or so I've heard it said) is that the earth itself
    doesn't dissipate heat, it transforms or transfers entropy.

        ericmay: > At any distance away from earth where space is so thin that heat
        dissipation is impossible, then the speed of light will be prohibitive of any
        workloads to/from space.  Why would they need to get data back to earth for near
        real time workloads? What we should be thinking about is how these things will
        operate in space and communicate with each other and whoever else is in space.
        The Earth is just ancient history

            reverius42: I feel like this is an incredibly fantastic goal-post-moving from
            the original announcement.  SpaceX: "we're going to put datacenters in space"
            HN comments: "obviously we'll need to move human civilization into space first
            for this to make sense. checks out."

                ericmay: I wasn’t responding to the original announcement, I was responding to
                someone who presumed that these data centers need to send data back to earth.  I
                was making a snide comment that certain ultra wealthy people don’t need these
                data centers to send data to earth, because they don’t plan on being here.

                    reverius42: Ah. Apologies, that went right over my head!

                        ericmay: All good haha I didn’t do a good enough job with it :)

    stogot: > You can't exchange heat with vacuum. You can only radiate heat into
    it.  I don’t remember the difference from my science classes, isn’t This the
    same thing essentially?

        FabHK: The other two methods of heat transfer apart from radiation are
        conduction (through “touch”, adjacent molecules, eg from the outside of a
        chicken on the BBQ to the inside) and convection (through movement, eg cold air
        or water flowing past).

    m463: I used to really enjoy musk's talks when he was spooling up tesla.  He was
    an engineer and obviously the world is missing what engineers see clearly.  But
    now looking back and accounting for the claims he made there's a pattern.  I saw
    this article:  https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-very-simple-pattern-to-...
    that said... he did jumpstart the EV industry.  He has put up satellites every
    week for years.  He is still a net benefit to all of us.

        dsl: > he did jumpstart the EV industry. He has put up satellites every week for
        years. He is still a net benefit to all of us.  Talk to any former SpaceX or
        Tesla employee. They will clue you in that both were successful in spite of
        Elon, not because of him.  The Cybertruck was really the first product he saw to
        completion from his own design. And well...

            dboreham: I think you under appreciate him a bit here. No he's not a super
            genius. He's probably not even a good engineer. But he is a) a total a.hole and
            b) a tremendous bullshitter. There are circumstances in which you need such a
            person to succeed (see also Steve Jobs). He yelled at people for 10 years
            straight and he was crucial in facilitating capital to build these very capital
            intensive products. A regular smart person would absolutely not have succeeded,
            for these reasons.

                someothherguyy: > bullshitter  why is lying at the edge of committing fraud so
                respected?

                    theshrike79: It makes the stock go up and people earn crazy amounts of money.

                        notrustincloud: iff "earn" == "receive"

                            randallsquared: In the absence of force or fraud, those are the same, more or
                            less.

                    m463: I've always thought that outlier kinds of people are very valuable.  For
                    example - richard stallman is pedantically correct about many things regarding
                    licenses or privacy or any number of related subjects.  But nobody can
                    wholeheartedly accept and adopt his viewpoint and behave as he does (no phone,
                    doesn't use non-free software, etc)  Musk is similar in his promises and
                    predictions.  Nobody can wholeheartedly accept his views.  But the reason these
                    folks are valuable are - they move the goalposts.  Moving the goalposts moves
                    the thoughts and behavior of people close to their viewpoints, and can
                    eventually unseat the complacent middle.  imho :)  EDIT: I think nobody is
                    immune to this.  Lots of people will understand the bullshit is deep when
                    someone comes up to them and relentlessly over-the-top flatters them.  But they
                    are likely to listen to and accept the person, logic be damned.

        rsynnott: > he did jumpstart the EV industry.  This is widely believed
        (especially in the US, where, other than the Leaf, most early electric cars
        never launched), but honestly pretty dubious. The first real electric cars, with
        significant production:  2010 - Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Nissan Leaf  2011 - Smart
        electric, Volvo C30 electric, Ford Focus electric, BYD e6.  2012 - Renault Zoe
        (Renault launched a couple of other vehicles on the same platform ~2010, but
        they never saw significant production), Tesla Model S (Tesla had a prior car,
        the Roadster, but it never saw significant production).  2013 - VW eUP, eGolf
        (VW occasionally put out an electric Golf historically, going back to 1992, but
        again those were never produced in large quantities).  The big change ~2010 was
        around the economics of lithium ion batteries; they finally got cheap enough
        that everyone started pulling their concept designs and small-scale
        demonstration models into full production.

    test6554: AI sovereignty, not AI efficiency. Redesign AI chips with lower power
    density and higher thermal tolerances and you get more efficient radiation with
    some sacrifice in compute power. But you are outside the jurisdiction of every
    country.  Then you get people paying much more money to use less-tightly-
    moderated space-based AI rather than heavily moderated AI.

    energy123: What in particular is wrong/misleading in the Starcloud whitepaper,
    then?  https://starcloudinc.github.io/wp.pdf

        deepfriedchokes: Probably this bit on page 4, which parent comment addresses:
        “More efficient cooling architecture taking advantage of higher ΔT in space.”

        mmoustafa: They do not at any point outline how cooling will be done, they
        simply say "it will be more efficient than chillers due to the larger delta T"
        which is incorrect because it's about dT not delta T

        beloch: In Table 1, the cost of cooling of a terrestrial data centre is listed
        as $7M.  The cost of cooling in space is assigned a value of $0 with the claim:
        "More efficient cooling architecture taking advantage of higher ΔT in space"  My
        bold claim:  The cost of cooling will not be $0.  The cost of launching that
        cooling into space will also not be $0.  The cost of maintaining that
        mechanically complex cooling in space will not be $0.  They then throw in enough
        unrealistic calculations later in the "paper" to show that they thought about
        the actual cost at least a little bit.  Apparently just enough to conclude that
        it's so massive there's no way they're going to list it in the table.  Table 1
        is pure fantasy.

            WithinReason: That row specifically says "chiller energy cost" which is 0

        can have redundancy, but no feasable way to maintain;  - compare how much
        effort/energy/maintenance is required to have ISS or Tiangong space stations -
        these space datacenters sound ridiculous;  NB: I would be happy to be proven
        wrong. There are many things that are possible if we would invest effort (and
        money) into it, akin to JFK's "We choose to go to the Moon" talk. Sounded
        incredible, but it was done from nearly zero to Moon landing in ~7 years. Though
        as much as I udnerstand - napkin math for such scale of space data centers seem
        to need efforts that are orders or magnitude more than Apollo mission, i.e.
        launching Saturn V for years multiple times per day. Even with booster reuse
        technology this seems literally incredible (not to mention fuel/material costs).

            red75prime: A giant space datacenter with square kilometers of solar panels
            doesn't make sense. A cluster of Starlink-sized satellites, which orbit near
            each other(1) and which are connected using laser-links might make sense.  (1)
            There are orbital arrangements that allow satellites to stay close together with
            minimal orbital corrections. Scott Manley mentioned this in one of his videos.

                trymas: Sounds like we would want to elevate from water wasting on Earth to
                pollution in space.

    spoaceman7777: He goes on about putting a mass driver on the moon for ultra-low-
    cost space launches.  His plan here clearly hinges around using robots to create
    a fully-automated GPU manufacturing and launch facility on the moon. Not
    launching any meaningful number from earth.  Raises some big questions about
    whether there are actually sufficient materials for GPU manufacture on the
    moon... But, whatever the case, the current pitch of earth-launches that the
    people involved with this "space datacenter" thing are making is a lie. I think
    it just sounds better than outright saying "we're going to build a self-
    replicating robot factory on the moon", and we are in the age of lying.

        bendews: If any single country tried to create a whole production chain to
        single-handedly manufacture modern computer equipment it would be on the order
        of decades to see any result. Doing it on the moon is just not realistic this
        century, maybe the next one. Although i don't think the economics would ever
        work out.

            Findeton: Do you acknowledge how much change was there in the XX century? How
            can you probably make such predictions with such confidence?

    uoaei: The materialist take is that his plan is to eventually over-value and
    then trade on his company valuations, and also have another merger lined up for
    future personal financial bailouts.

    ExoticPearTree: > It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.
    Unfortunately no. The arctic region is too cold and humid. You need way more
    energy to manage the cooling of a datacenter there than somewhere hotter.

    ospray: The only way I see this actually working given the resource requirement
    is delta-v style with in orbit resource extraction using robots. By transferring
    heat to asteroids in the shade of the solar panels at L1 or something.
    https://share.google/uXWQyAp7a8nE03qoi

    PunchyHamster: It has been worked out. Just look at how big are ISS radiators
    and that they dissipate around 100kW then calculate cost of sending all that to
    space. And by that I mean it would be even more expensive that some of the
    estimates flying around  While personally I think it's another AI cash grab and
    he just wants to find some more customers for spacex, other thing is "you can't
    copyright infringe in space" so it might be perfect place to load that terabytes
    of stolen copyrighted material to train data sets, if some country suddenly
    decides corporation stealing copyright content is not okay any more

        CorrectHorseBat: Maybe you can't copyright infringe in space, but it's still
        infringement when the result gets back to earth.

            randyrand: Keep the result in space, and use large telescopes to look at it!

                RugnirViking: the result is the result. If you look at it and use it for
                something, you have moved the result. Its not a physical object that exists in a
                place, its an idea. Hence IP. Intellectual property.

                    estearum: Really depends on how good your lawyers are

            whycome: These major AI tools have already been trained on infringing works.

        pointlessone: DGX H200 is 10,2 kW. So that like 10 of them. Or only 80 H200.
        Doesn’t sound like a big data center. More like a server room.  ISS radiators
        are huge 13.6x3.1 m. Each radiates 35 kW. So you need 3 of them to have your 100
        kW target. They are also filled with gas that needs pumping so not exactly a
        passive system and as such can break down for a whole lot of reasons.  You also
        need to collect that power so you need about the same amount of power coming
        from solar panels. ISS solar array wings are 35x12 m and can generate about 31
        kW of power. So we’ll need at least 3 of them. BTW each weighs a ton, a literal
        metric ton.  It hardly seems feasible. Huge infrastructure costs for small AI
        server rooms in space.

            diabllicseagull: if I may add, you can't really launch a station three times the
            size of ISS with a single rocket so there will be multiple launches. Just the
            launch costs alone could likely finance multiple similarly sized server rooms on
            land.

                pointlessone: It should be smaller than ISS. IIRC, ISS has three solar arrays
                and two radiators. DGX is about the size of a fridge. Let’s add two more fridges
                worth of infra for solar and radiator. Maybe another fridge for comms. But these
                three fridges replace all the modules of ISS. It’s still gonna be about 6 (maybe
                up to 10?) tons of mass to lift. But Starship can do 100-150 tons to LEO so
                might be doable.

    abalone: > It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic.  What
    (literally) on earth makes you say this? The arctic has excellent cooling and
    extremely poor sun exposure. Where would the energy come from?  A satellite in
    sun-synchronous orbit would have approximately 3-5X more energy generation than
    a terrestrial solar panel in the arctic. Additionally anything terrestrial needs
    maintenance for e.g. clearing dust and snow off of the panels (a major concern
    in deserts which would otherwise seem to be ideal locations).  There are so many
    more considerations that go into terrestrial generation. This is not to deny the
    criticism of orbital panels, but rather to encourage a real and apolitical
    engineering discussion.

        PurpleRamen: > A satellite in sun-synchronous orbit would have approximately
        3-5X more energy generation than a terrestrial solar panel in the arctic.
        Building 3-5x more solar plants in the Arctic, would still be cheaper than
        travelling to space. And that's ignoring that there are other, more efficient
        plants possible. Even just building a long powerline around the globe to fetch
        it from warmer regions would be cheaper.

            IsTom: Sunlight is unevenly distributed in the arctic during the year to say the
            least.

            Kuinox: > Building 3-5x more solar plants in the Arctic, would still be cheaper
            than travelling to space.  Well first you have to make solar panels works in the
            polar nights, in winter they have a few minutes of sun in the day at most.

            abalone: > Even just building a long powerline around the globe to fetch it from
            warmer regions would be cheaper.  Deserts have good sun exposure and land
            availability but extremely poor water resources, which is necessary for washing
            the sand off the panels. There are many challenges with scaling both terrestrial
            and orbital solar.

                PurpleRamen: I wasn't thinking of going THAT far. Northern Canada/Alaska is in
                the arctic region, so build the line some thousand miles down to the sunny parts
                of Canada/USA and call it done. Not like this is particularly hard, probably not
                even that expensive, compared to a million satellites/future space-debris.
                Greenland would probably be also a good location.

    KaiserPro: Its not just cooling thats totally not worked out, its internal
    networking, its power management (what happens when its in darkness?) how do you
    certify servers for +/-10g vibration
    (https://www.ralspace.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Dynamics-and-vibration...)  What about
    gamma rays? there is a reason why "space hardened" microcontrollers are MIPS
    chips from the 90s on massive dies with a huge wedge of metal on it. You can't
    just take a normal 4micron die and yeet it into space and have done with it.
    Then there is the downlink. If you want low latency, then you need to be in Low
    earth orbit. That means that you'll spend >40% of your time in darkness. So not
    only do you need to have a MAssive heat exchanger and liquid cooling loop, which
    is space rated, you need to have ?20mwhr of battery as well (also cooled/heated
    because swinging +/- 140 C every 90 minutes is not going to make them happy)
    Then there is data consistency, is this inference only? or are we expecting to
    have a mesh network that can do whole "datacentre" cache coherence? because I
    have bad news for you if you're going to try that.  Its just complete and total
    bollocks.  utter utter bollocks.

        PinkiesBrain: You don't put it in a standard orbit, you put it in a polar orbit
        with near 100% suntime ... obviously.  Obviously you use the backside of the
        massive area of PV you need, for an equally massive area for HOPG radiator films
        with condensor coils (because obviously you use heatpumps for cooling, not pure
        liquid).  Consider the obvious ways you'd actually do it, not the most naive
        ways.  The GPU pods obviously won't weigh the same as a terrestrial rack. Space
        based solar arrays obviously don't weigh the same as your hail and storm
        resistant panels on your roof (see ROSA, but there might be another 10x weight
        reduction if using flexible solar in tension from rotation). Noone cares about a
        couple 100 ms extra for first token.  Solar wind and drag are in my opinion the
        biggest issue. Problem : it's a giant surface catching drag and solar wind.
        Solution : it's a giant solar sail. Controlling the angle of PV for useful
        thrust, that's never really been done for a satellite.

    owaislone: or perhaps as simple as saving xAI for himself as he prepares to
    offload rest of Twitter?

    andix: I think Musk is backed into a corner financially. Most of his companies
    don't have that much revenue and their worth is mostly based on hope.  They
    might be closer to collapsing than most people think. It's not unheard of that a
    billionaires net worth drops to zero over night.  I think it's mostly financial
    reasons why they merged the companies, this space datacenter idea was born to
    justify the merge of SpaceX and xAI. To give investors hope, not to really do
    it.

    weinzierl: "A satellite is, if nothing else, a fantastic thermos."  A satellite
    is quite unlike a thermos in the sense that it is carefully tuned to keep its
    temperature within a relatively narrow band around room temperature.[1] during
    all operational phases.  This is because, despite intended space usage, devices
    and parts are usually tested and qualified for temperature limits around room
    temperature.  [1] "Room temperature" is actually a technical term meaning 20°C
    (exceptions in some fields and industries confirm the rule).

        throw-qqqqq: > 1] "Room temperature" is actually a technical term meaning 20°C
        (exceptions in some fields and industries confirm the rule).  Yes 20 and 25°C I
        believe are the two most popular choices. In many cases it makes little
        difference with units in Kelvin ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    latexr: > Musk is up to something here. This could be another hyperloop (i.e. A
    distracting promise meant to sabotage competition). It could be a legal dodge.
    It could be a power grab.  It could also just be ignorance and talking out of
    his ass to look smart. Like when he took over Twitter and began publicly spewing
    wrong technical details as if he knew what he was talking about and being
    corrected by the people actually working on the product.

    killerstorm: People did the calculation: radiative cooling requires smaller
    surface area than solar panels. So, basically, a solar panel itself can radiate
    heat.  Have you done a calculation yourself?

        Numerlor: How can the solar panel itself radiate heat when it's being heated up
        generating supplying power? Looking at pictures of the ISS there's radiators
        that look like they're there specifically to cool the solar panels.  And even if
        viable, why would you just not cool using air down on earth? Water is used for
        cooling because it increases effectiveness significantly, but even a closed loop
        system with simple dry air heat exchangers is quite a lot more effective than
        radiative cooling

            Symmetry: You take the amount of energy absorbed by the solar panels and
            subtract the amount they radiate.  Most things in physics are linear systems
            that work like this.

        drtz: The same radiative (radiant) cooling on Earth works almost just as well,
        but without the cost of a rocket launch.

    coliveira: Jeffrey Epstein's friend Elon Musk is trying to stop a financial
    disaster in xAi that would expose how irresponsible he is. He's gonna put all
    that in a company that has real money coming from government and soon will get
    retail investors money.

    trimethylpurine: You can't exchange heat with vacuum  If you put a pipe with hot
    gas inside, in space, it will get colder by convection.  Blow air through the
    pipe.

        valec: ok. your pipe is full. now what

    wendgeabos: I have reached the same conclusion -- this is perhaps not a
    distraction but an attempt to gather funds to pursue the One True Goal...

    TechSquidTV: I have no idea how it compares to the heat being generated, but one
    advantage of space would be totally efficient radiative cooling, I believe.
    Assuming you can pump the heat, and can deploy a large enough surface area (the
    key question I assume), then you have that at least.

    dev_l1x_be: The Stefan-Boltzmann Law tells us that radiative power scales to the
    fourth power of temperature (T^4). While terrestrial cooling is largely linear
    and dependent on ambient air/water temperature (the "wet-bulb" limit), a
    radiator in space is dumping heat into a 3-Kelvin sink. That thermal gradient is
    massive.

        shadowgovt: Stefan-Boltzmann is about absolute, not relative temperature.  When
        one does the math on the operating temperatures of regular computing equipment
        that we use on Earth, how much heat it generates per watt, and how fast it would
        need to sink that heat to allow for continuous operation, one gets surface areas
        that are not impossible, but are pretty on the high end of anything we've ever
        built in space.  And then you have to deflect the incoming light from the Sun
        which will be adding to your temperature (numbers published by private space
        companies regarding the tolerances of payloads those companies are willing to
        carry note that those payloads have to be tolerant of temperatures exceeding
        100° C, from solar radiation alone). That is doable, you could sunshield the
        sensitive equipment and possibly decrease some of your thermal input load by
        putting your craft out near L2 which hangs out in the penumbra of Earth. Still a
        daunting technical challenge when the alternative is just build it on the planet
        with the technology and methods we already have.

            dev_l1x_be: You’re correct that Stefan-Boltzmann uses absolute temperature (K),
            but that only reinforces the advantage of moving the "hot side" of the gradient
            up. If you increase your radiator temp from 300K (standard Earth ambient) to
            360K (hot silicon), your radiative efficiency doesn't just go up by 20%—it
            nearly doubles.  The Solar Load is Directional: Unlike a terrestrial atmosphere
            where heat is omnidirectional, space allows for "shadow engineering." A simple
            multi-layer insulation (MLI) sunshield can reduce solar flux by orders of
            magnitude. We do this for the James Webb Space Telescope to keep instruments at
            7K while the sun-facing side is at 380K. For a data center, you don't need 7K;
            you just need to keep the "dark side" radiators in the shade.

        papercrane: The thermal gradient in space is meaningless because there is hardly
        any matter to dump the energy into. This means you are entirely reliant on
        thermal radiation. If you look at the numbers given by Stefan-Boltzmann law
        you'd see that means to radiate a significant amount of energy you need a
        combination of a lot of surface area and high temperatures.  This means you need
        some sort of heat pump. For a practical example you can look at the ISS, which
        has what they call the "External Active Thermal Control System" (EATCS), it's a
        complicated system and it provides 70kW of heat rejection. A datacenter in space
        would need to massively scale up such a system in order to cool itself.

            dev_l1x_be: The ISS comparison is a bit of a category mismatch. The EATCS is
            complex because it’s a life-support system that must keep humans at exactly 22C
            (295K) while managing ammonia loops in a manned environment.  Computers aren't
            humans. High-performance silicon can comfortably operate at a junction
            temperature of 80C to 90C (approx. 360K). Because of that T^4 relationship, a
            radiator at 85C rejects nearly double the heat per square meter than a radiator
            at 20C, unless I miss something.  So this makes it a bit more nuanced.

        Dasistmeinname: This is misleading: - A radiator only “sees” 3 K if it’s
        perfectly shielded from the Sun, Earth albedo, and Earth IR. In Earth orbit you
        can easily get hundreds of W/m^2 incident; without sunshields the net rejectable
        heat is greatly reduced. - You have a "massive" advantage only if the radiator
        is allowed to run very hot: At 300–310 K with \epsilon \approx 0.9: about
        400–500 W/m^2. Effective "radiative heat transfer coefficient" at 300 K: h_rad
        \approx 4\epsilon\sigma T^3 \approx 5-6 W/m^2K. That's orders of magnitude lower
        than forced convection in air (\approx 50–500 W/m^2K) or the water side of a
        heat exchanger (>=1000 W/m^2K).

            dev_l1x_be: Yeah I took the best case scenario in space, I did not account for
            anything else. I imagine the space DC be like two sides, one is pointing towards
            the sun and being a solar panel the other is a cold radiator radiating heat into
            the void. I am not sure how feasible this is.

    micromacrofoot: It's not just Musk, Google is working on it too... very soon to
    actually launch tests. I have a feeling it's a regulatory dodge of some kind.

    littlestymaar: > It makes far more sense to build data centers in the arctic
    This. Like it would make far more sense to colonize the poles than Mars.

    phtrivier: > Musk is up to something here. This could be another hyperloop (i.e.
    A distracting promise meant to sabotage competition). It could be a legal dodge.
    It could be a power grab. What it will not be is a useful source of computing
    power. Anyone who takes this venture seriously is probably going to be burned.
    That.  Also, am I the only one to remember when SpaceX was supposed to pivot to
    transporting people from cities to cities, given how cheap and reusable and sure
    BFF/Starship was going to be ?  Or how we were all going to earn money by
    pooling our full self driving cars in a network of robo taxis ?  In all
    seriousness, what is the number of "unrealized sci-fi pipe dreams" that is
    acceptable from the owner a company ? Or, to be fair, what is the acceptable
    ratio of "pipe dreams" / "actually impressive stuff actually delivered (reusable
    rockets, starlink, decent EVs, etc...)" ?

    vonneumannstan: Yeah the Space Data Center companies completely gloss over this
    fact by saying "oh yeah and we'll need radiators 10x the size of our solar
    panels. NBD."

    Symmetry: Space is a vacuum and yet here we are on a rock floating in space
    warmed by the sun and the temperate is actually pretty comfortable.  Indeed,
    without the greenhouse effect it would be positively chilly.  An important part
    of a thermos is that you have to use high albedo materials in the vacuum chamber
    or else it would lose heat too quickly to radiation.  A satellite as a whole
    will come to thermal equilibrium with space at a fairly reasonable temperature,
    the problematic part is that the properties of electricity make it easy to
    concentrate a good part of the incoming energy in a small area where the GPU is.
    Heat is harder to move than electricity and getting that heat back out to the
    solar panels or radiators requires either heavy heat pipes or complex coolant
    pumps.

        its-summertime: a data center in space doesn't have a gigantic rock taking up
        most of its area, a data center in space is 100% data center 0% rock.  If it had
        the same data center to rock ratio as earth, it would just end up being earth in
        the end, and earth doesn't seem to be wanting to stick to its equilibrium either
        right now

            xavortm: Well, they do have silicon, with some more additives they can make
            rocks in space! And throw them at earth, that will show em

            Symmetry: The rock in this case acts as extra thermal mass that makes it take
            longer to reach thermal equilibrium, but doesn't change what the ultimate
            thermal equilibrium is.  Only the configuration of the parts of the surface that
            can absorb or radiate electromagnetic radiation do that.  And because rock is a
            fairly good insulator we only really benefit from the top layer and if the sun
            went out we would all freeze in a week or so.

                its-summertime: it changes the amount of exposed area to release heat back into
                the universe. if you have a non-negligible amount of compute compared to earth,
                you are going to be approaching a non-negligible amount of space required to
                radiate that away, along with all the other costs and maintainability issues

                    Symmetry: The formula for the equilibrium temperature for a sphere in sunlight
                    is      2 * pi * r^2 * L / (4 * pi * d) * (1 -a) = 4 * pi * r^2 * sigma * T^4
                    As you can see there are pi*r^2 on both sides of the equation, the surface area
                    to cross section ratio of a sphere doesn't change as it gets bigger and so the
                    equilibrium temperature doesn't change no matter how big the sphere is.  (d is
                    the distance to the Sun, nothing to do with the sphere itself).

    DiscourseFan: I don’t believe you’ve considered the possibility of a data center
    on Pluto…  But in all seriousness, if there is a possibility of building
    industrial centers outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, it is surely not here yet.
    Lots of areas would need improvement.

    goalieca: > Musk is up to something here.  This is Musk, yet again, pulling
    themes from sci-fi books. He has that vision of ushering in the "future" which

    the Kardashev scale and his vision for getting us forward like in the novel
    accelerando.

    rootnod3: “Musk is on to something here”? Really?  Any high school student with
    a basic grasp of physics could explain that. But sure, the idiot billionaire
    nazi “is on to something”.  That’s giving him too much credit.  Of course it
    doesn’t fucking make sense to put data centers into space. Even if heating were
    solved somehow magically, server disks are veeery prone to fail and need
    replacement. Shoot a rocket up every week to replace failed drives or absolutely
    burned through GPUs? Yeah, that doesn’t even remotely sound feasible.

            rootnod3: And burn even more energy and fuel than DCs on the ground, great idea
            :D

                jvanderbot: Nobody said it was a good idea except his accountant, who doesn't
                pay the energy bills.

    osigurdson: I suspect Musk has a workable plan of some sort, realistically.
    Clearly, the one thing that is available in space is an abundance of square
    meters. There is no need whatsoever to conserve space at sufficient orbit. It is
    a little counter intuitive as we are so used to needing to conserve all the
    things.  Power input and heat radiation both scale with area so maybe there is
    some way to achieve this at scale. For instance, maybe it will not look like a
    traditional data center or even traditional chips.

        torginus: The rumor I heard is that Musk's big issue with SpaceX was that he was
        only able to employ US citizens with a security clearance, as per the
        limitations of a rocket company, which he has rallied against multiple times.
        One of the motivations behind this whole thing could be that he could make a way
        for foreign talent to work on space projects without the necessary government
        signoff.

            osigurdson: Would that really be that much of an unlock?

                torginus: Yes. I don't have an estimate right off the bat, but if you considered
                all the people employed at top tech companies, what percentage do you think are
                US nationals eligible for a security clearance?  I'd say less than a third.

                    osigurdson: I had a look at SpaceX career page. There are 128 software related
                    roles available. Perhaps half of those could be filled by big tech type
                    companies, the others are more specialized (like antenna software engineer). I
                    don't think that 64 open positions would move the needle really. And, if it were
                    that easy to get around the security clearance by having another company, he
                    could have created a new / separate company years ago.  Wouldn't a simpler
                    explanation be that SpaceX is making a lot of money while xAI is losing a lot.
                    If funds have to flow through Elon personally it is likely complicated and
                    costly. Also, if the "space data center" idea is actually workable (I have no
                    idea if it is) then it does make some logical sense as well.   Of course,
                    Twitter just seems like kind of a write off to me at this point.

    bigbuppo: He's got a trillion dollar compensation package on the line. You can
    absolutely guarantee he's doing something shady.

    skeptic_ai: The 4-5nm gpu will break from high energy protons from the sun.  Lag
    for roundtrip: 35ms. But when satelite needs to pass through other satellites as
    has no ground coverage you add more lag and reduce bandwidth of the whole
    network.  The best part is jurisdiction safety. Very hard to get raided by govs.

    notaustinpowers: It links his middling AI company and his failing social media
    company with the only company that can send the United States to space.  X
    failing and can't pay its debts? Welp, better give him a government bailout
    otherwise no more rockets for you!

        the_real_cher: This exactly.  His other companies are failing. He links the
        shitty companies with the only one working.

    catoc: Exactly - satellites need to be cooled to prevent overheating that
    wouldn’t happen on earth.  (Space doesn’t help in cooling GPUs in a satellite -
    space makes cooling worse)

    fsckboy: >i.e. The lack-of-a-thing that makes a thermos great at keeping your
    drink hot  e.g. the lack-of-a-thing that makes a thermos great at keeping your
    drink cold too

        catoc: Yes but in this case the lack-of-a-thing keeps GPUs hot

            fsckboy: people who do understand thermodynamics will already understand the
            problem, but innocent people who don't understand thermodynamics should not be
            misled by poorly chosen examples presented as proof.

        fwipsy: At risk of stating the obvious - computers produce heat. "Keeping them
        cool" really means dissipating that heat. Insulating them will cause them to get
        hotter.

    EGreg: The ideal would be to park the data centers at the lagrange point behind
    the Earth in its umbra, so they don't need to dissipate direct solar heat.

    jmalicki: "But even if we stipulate that radiation, cooling, latency, and launch
    costs are all solved, other fundamental issues still make orbital data centers,
    at least as SpaceX understands them, a complete fantasy. "  I'm pretty his point
    is that while cooling is an impossibility, it is not the only one!

    dfabulich: In 2024, Starcloud posted their plans to "solve" the cooling problem.
    https://starcloudinc.github.io/wp.pdf  > As conduction and convection to the
    environment are not available in space, this means the data center will require
    radiators capable of radiatively dissipating gigawatts of thermal load. To
    achieve this, Starcloud is developing a lightweight deployable radiator design
    with a very large area - by far the largest radiators deployed in space -
    radiating primarily towards deep space...  They claim they can radiate "633.08 W
    / m^2". At that rate, they're looking at square kilometers of radiators to
    dissipate gigawatts of thermal load, perhaps hectares of radiators.  They also
    claim that they can "dramatically increase" heat dissipation with heat pumps.
    So, there you have it: "all you have to do" is deploy a few hectares of
    radiators in space, combined with heat pumps that can dissipate gigawatts of
    thermal load with no maintenance at all over a lifetime of decades.  This seems
    like the sort of "not technically impossible" problem that can attract a large
    amount of VC funding, as VCs buy lottery tickets that the problem can be solved.

        estimator7292: Yes, on the face of it, the plan is workable. Heat radiation
        scales linearly with area and exponentially (IIRC) with temperature.  It really
        is as simple as just adding kilometers of radiatiors. That is, if you ignore the
        incredible cost of transporting all that mass to orbit and assembly in space.
        Because there is quite simply no way to fold up kilometer-scale thermal arrays
        and launch in a single vehicle. There will be assembly required in space.  All
        in all, if you ignore all practical reality, yes, you can put a datacenter in
        space!  Once you engage a single brain cell, it becomes obvious that it is
        actually so impractical as to be literally impossible.

    slashdev: As an engineer of the software variety, logically heat dissipation
    would seem like a difficult problem.  But SpaceX has lots of real engineers who
    are very smart. I’m certain they ran the math on it. Which is more than you or I
    have done.  If they say it can be done, I’m inclined to believe them.

        therein: Wow. Definitely not a textbook fallacy.  I mean why think about
        anything, you know. Critical thinking is for losers, am I right?

            paulryanrogers: I think it's more an appeal to (expert) authority

    foobiekr: Musk lies with ease and routinely. This and Optimus are both just more
    examples of that.

    tim333: >I would not assume cooling has been worked out  On the other hand
    Starlink has several thousand satellites up there using solar power to run
    processors and cooling them with radiators so it's not totally new technology.
    Here's a Musk tweet linking some analysis
    https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2013676764099199156

    DoctorOetker: > Space is a vacuum. i.e. The lack-of-a-thing that makes a thermos
    great at keeping your drink hot.  1) The heat can be transported by a heat
    carrier conducting heat standing still.  2) The heat can be transported by a
    heat carrier in motion.  3) The heat can be transported by thermal radiation.
    The first 2 require massive particles, the latter are spontaneous photons.  A
    thermos bottle does not simply work by eliminating the motile mass particles.
    Lets consider room temperature as the outer thermos temperature and boiling hot
    water as the inner temperature, that is roughly 300 K and 400 K.  Thermal
    radiation is proportional to the fourth power of temperature and proportional to
    emissivity (which is between 0 and 1).  Lets pretend you are correct and thus
    thermally blackened glass (emissivity 1) inside the vacuum flask would be fine
    according to you. That would mean that the radiation from your tea to the room
    temperature side would be proportional to 400^4 while the thermal radiation from
    room temperature to the tea would be proportional to 300^4. Since (400/300) ^ 4
    = 3.16 that means the heat transport from hot tea to room temperature is about 3
    times higher.  If on the other hand the glass was aluminized before being pulled
    vacuum the heat transports are proportional to 0 * 400 K ^ 4 and 0 * 300 K ^ 4 .
    So the heat transport in either direction would be 0 and no net heat transport
    remains.  If you believe the shiny inside of your thermos flask is an aesthetic
    gimmick, think again.  You are making a non-comparison.  Imagine comparing a
    diesel engine car to an electric car, but first removing the electric motor.
    Does that make a fair comparison???

        estimator7292: Nobody made any of the claims you're "refuting".  You've imagined
        an argument so you can dunk on it to appear superior.  In addition, thermoses
        aren't made of glass. It is far more common to make them out of steel or
        aluminum.

    timmit: This is my 2 cents, I have an engineer background, not space science
    background.  At earth or above sea, we use cooling to maintain the temperature
    below 60 degrees, or 80 or 100 or something.  Shadow of space is -157 degrees,
    the cooling design will be different.

b00ty4breakfast: They're gonna propose something dumb like ejecting coolant out
into space as a disposable heatsink and then they're gonna spend a bunch of
money trying to build a proof-of-concept but it will never go anywhere because
it's really some kinda money laundering scheme or whatever the Hyperloop
nonsense was.

    anywhichway: Musk said in his autobiography he announced the hyperloop plan
    without any intention of doing it to distract from the California high speed
    rail plans.

fd-codier: We were supposed to be on Mars right now, but I guess data centers in
space are nice too. Kinda disappointed they aren't on the moon.

wanderinghogan: If we won't stop what he is doing with grok and ai-generated
CSAM, he will be completely free from oversight up there.

    Findecanor: As silly as that sounds, you gave me a thought ...  If SpaceX, by
    being a company serving the federal government are covered by a law that would
    make its offices (on Earth, duh) a protected area ... then could they by some
    law-bending make that protection also encompass the data centres that contain
    the AI-generated CSAM and training data, in order to protect them from being
    raided by state law enforcement?  That does not have to sound reasonable to us
    ... only to Musk.

    undsoft: Dealing with rogue AI also seems easier when you can walk up to its
    data center and unplug it.

zer00eyz: Admiral Grace Hopper is famous for using a length of wire to explain
to others what a nanosecond was.  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-
embraces-musks-g...  Data centers in space make absolute sense when you want as
close to real time analysis on all sorts of information. Would you rather have
it make the round trip, via satellite to the states? Or are you going to build
these things on the ground near a battlefield?  Musk is selling a vision for a
MASSIVE government contract to provide a service that no one else could hope to
achieve. This is one of those projects where he can run up the budget and
operating costs like Boeing, Northrup etc, because it has massive military
applications.

timmmmmmay: you know you're looking at some hard analysis when they use the
number "gazillion". can I get that one in scientific notation?

nvader: What data centers in space enable is protection for the compute of near-
superintelligent AIs from the interference of humans.  As an alleged human, I'd
like to preserve my option to interfere.

    e12e: No, no, no - Villa Starlight was the prison the Tessier-Ashpool AI needed
    help to escape from!

krater23: How else would you secure skynet against Sarah Connor?

kibwen: No no, let Musk cook. This definitely won't be SpaceX's Cybertruck
moment, where they completely throw away their first-mover advantage by wasting
five years chasing after the egotistical boondoggle of a delusional
megalomaniac.

bs7280: As a thought experiment, if humanity wanted to go all in on trying to
move industrial processes and data centers off planet, would it make more sense
to do so on the moon?  The moon has:  - Some water  - Some materials that can be
used to manufacture crude things (like heat sinks?)  - a ton of area to brute
force the heat sink problem  - a surface to burry the data centers under to
solve the radiation problem  - close enough to earth that remote controlled
semi-automated robots work  I think this would only work if some powerful entity
wanted to commit to a hyper-scale effort.

    vel0city: What if instead we moved it all to a closer rock that has even more
    water, even more materials to manufacture crude (and even advanced) things, even
    more surface, more protection from radiation, and even crazier still had
    significantly less launch costs?  Almost any reason why the moon is better than
    in orbit is a point for putting it on earth.

        bs7280: I think there's something to be said about imagining a future where we
        can keep the earth clean of all the nasty industrial processes we have grown
        accustomed to living next to. A big part about this proposed idea is that you
        could do a lot of manufactoring in space.  I have long theorized there will be
        some game changing manufacturing processes that can only be done in a zero
        gravity environment. EX:  - 3d printing human organ replacements to solve the
        organ donor problem  - stronger materials  - 3d computer chips  I do not work in
        material science, so these crude ideas are just that, but the important part I'm
        getting at is that we can make things in space without any launches once that
        industry is bootstrapped.

            chuckadams: Human organs manage to grow pretty well in 1G.  In fact, they're
            almost certainly going to be terrible at it in zero g.

            vel0city: We're able to make 3D computer chips on Earth today, and I don't know
            about you but all my organs managed to get made just fine on Earth. Doesn't seem
            like we need zero g to do either of these things.  Either way, this isn't about
            3D printing organs, this is about launching AI compute into space. To do
            important stuff, like making AI generated CSAM without worry of government
            intervention.

                bs7280: The first two kidneys are free its the third one that gets tricky

    vidarh: Probably a lot easier, but the moon looses a major selling point of data
    centres in space, namely reasonable latency. To be clear, I don't think it's a
    good idea. But I think that specifically the way Musk is trying to position it,
    the moon would be an even harder sell.

        TacticalCoder: > But I think that specifically the way Musk is trying to
        position it, the moon would be an even harder sell.  I agree. I would be quite a
        moonshot.

    snewman: Water on the moon is limited and difficult to collect, it wouldn't make
    sense to use it for industrial purposes. It's a very challenging thermal
    environment (baking during the day, freezing at night). But perhaps worst of
    all, every month there's a 14-day period with no solar power. Overall seems
    worse than low-earth orbit.

        munchler: > every month there's a 14-day period with no solar power  So it's
        dark 50% of the time on the moon... just like here on Earth.

            foxglacier: ... and completely not like a sun-synchronous Earth orbit which is
            dark 0% of the time.

    strangeloops85: The elephant in the room for all lunar scenarios is lunar
    regolith. Even ignoring the toxicity to humans (big problem and will happen
    quite quickly for any humans there!), it will be a big long-term problem for
    robots and machinery in general.

        vel0city: A lot of people don't quite understand how terrible of a material
        lunar regolith dust is. There's not much stuff on Earth quite like it. The Moon
        doesn't experience any weathering, so its all super sharp and jagged compared to
        how smooth even the grittiest sand is here on Earth. Its electrostatically
        charged so it wants to cling to dang near everything. Its highly toxic to
        breathe in for the same reason as miner's lung. It will work its way into every
        joint and seal.

    DaedalusII: it could be easier just to build in orbit. its a lot closer, sites
    can be positioned above various geographic locations as required.  i think the
    moon likely does contain vast mineral deposits though. when europeans first
    started exploring australia they found mineral anomalies that havent existed in
    europe since the bronze age.  the Pilbara mining region is very cool. it
    contains something like 25% of the iron ore on earth, and it is mostly mined
    using 100% remote controlled robots and a custom built 1000 mile rail network
    that runs 200-300 wagon trains, mostly fully automated. it is the closest thing
    to factorio in real life. 760,100 tonnes a year of iron ore mined out and
    shipped to China.

        rswail: And Fortescue and others are working on BEV vehicles for those giant
        Tonka trucks that move the raw ore to the processing areas at the top of the
        opencut.  They were also working on a "zero energy" train that would run
        "downhill" from the mines to the ports to charge its batteries that would then
        take the empty train back to the mine.  Battery tech wasn't sufficient (yet),
        but that doesn't mean it can't come back when solid state and sodium ion
        batteries come online.

            DaedalusII: have to take this stuff with a grain of salt. a lot of australian
            mining companies do this so their stock qualifies as ESG and pension funds can
            buy it.  turns out pit mining is good for the environment after all
            https://www.fortescue.com/en/real-zero/green-metals

    hahahahhaah: Best bet is to put the servers in a rocket, go around the moon then
    land back on earth. Then install them in USE1.

    BurningFrog: The Moon also has 14 day long nights, while space has permanent
    sunlight for your solar panels.  I suspect this is really the fundamental idea
    behind this whole plan.

jiggawatts: There are two very distinct kinds of AI workloads that go into data
centres:      1. Inference     2. Training  Inference just might be doable in
space because it is "embarrassingly parallel" and can be deployed as a swarm of
thousands of satellites, each carrying the equivalent of a single compute node
with 8x GPUs. The inputs and outputs are just text, which is low bandwidth. The
model parameters only need to be uploaded a few times a year, if that. Not much
storage is required , just a bit of flash for the model, caching, logging, and
the like. This is very similar to a Starlink satellites, just with bigger solar
panels and some additional radiative cooling. Realistically, a spacecraft like
this would use inference-optimised chips, not power-hungry general purpose
NVIDIA GPUs, LPDDR5 instead of HBM, etc...  Training is a whole other ballgame.
It is parallelisable, sure, but only through heroic efforts involving
fantastically expensive network switches with petabits of aggregated bandwidth.
It also needs more general-purpose GPUs, access to petabytes of data, etc. The
name of the game here is to bring a hundred thousand or more GPUs into close
proximity and connect them with a terabit or more per GPU to exchange data. This
cannot be put into orbit with any near-future technologies! It would be a giant
satellite with square kilometers of solar and cooling panels. It would certainly
get hit sooner or later by space debris, not to mention the hazard it poses to
other satellites.  The problem with putting inference-only into space is that
training still needs to go somewhere, and current AI data centres are pulling
double-duty: they're usable for both training and inference, or any mix of the
two. The greatest challenge is that a training bleeding edge model needs the
biggest possible clusters (approaching a million GPUs!) in one place, and that
is the problem -- few places in the world can provide the ~gigawatt of power to
light up something that big. Again, the problem here is that training workloads
can't be spread out.  Space solves the "wrong" problem! We can distribute
inference to thousands of datacentre locations here on Earth, each needs just
hundreds of kilowatts. That's no problem.  It's the giaaaant clusters everyone
is trying to build that are the problem.

luxuryballs: Like I’ve always said love him or hate him Elon Musk is a SPACE OIL
SALESMAN!

DustinBrett: Comments full of EDS. Everyone is a rocket scientist in here also.

pokstad: > Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost effective
relative to normal data centers.  Author made a fatal mistake. By flying enough
hardware in space, you can simply blot out the sun and steal their solar
capacity. Drink their milkshake with a long straw!

tgbugs: One way to work around the heat dissipation issues in space (and also on
earth) is to move to computing systems that operate entirely at cryogenic
temperatures to take advantage of superconducting circuitry.  I've heard stories
that over a decade ago teams inside hyperscalars had calculated that running
completely cryogenically cooled data centers would be vastly cheaper than what
we do now due to savings on resistive losses and the cost of eliminating waste
heat. You don't have to get rid of heat that you don't generate in the first
place.  The issue is that at the moment there are very few IC components and
processes that have been engineered to run at cryogenic temperatures.
Replicating the entirety of the existing data center stack for cryogenic temps
is nowhere near reality.  That said, once you have cryogenic superconducting
integrated circuits you could colocate your data centers and your
propellant/oxidizer depots. Not exactly "data centers off in deep space" since
propoxd tend to be the highest traffic areas.

    spongebobstoes: by my calculations, the heat dissipation isn't that big a deal
    take an h100 for example. it will need something like 1kW to operate. that's
    less than 4 square meters of solar panel  at 70C, a reasonable temp for H100, a
    4 square meter radiator can emit north of 2kW of energy into deep space  seems
    to me like a 2x2x2 cube could house an H100 in space  perhaps I'm missing
    something?

        variaga: Heat travels when there is a thermal gradient. What thermally
        superconducting material are you going to make your cube out of that the surface
        temperature is exactly the same as the core temperature? If you don't have one,
        then to keep the h100 at 70c, the radiators have to be colder.  How much more
        radiator area do you need then?  Have you considered the effects of insolation?
        Sunlight heats things too.  How efficient is your power supply and how much
        waste heat is generated delivering 1kW you your h100?  How do you move data
        between the ground and your satellite? How much power does that take?  If it's
        in LEO, how many thermal cycles can your h100 survive? If it's not in LEO, go
        back to the previous question and add an order of magnitude.  I could go on, but
        honestly those details - while individually solvable - don't matter because
        there is no world where you would not be better off taking the exact same h100
        and installing it somewhere on the ground instead

            spongebobstoes: h100 can operate at 80-90C continuously, so 70C seems
            conservative  I'm not advocating for space GPUs as a logical next step. so many
            unsolved problems remain  point is that launch costs per kg are a more realistic
            blocker than cooling

        cdf: The typical GPU cloud machine will have 8 H100s in a box. I didnt check
        your math but if a single machine needs 32 square meter radiator, 200 machines
        will probably be the size comparable to the ISS.  How much does it cost to
        launch just the mass of something that big?  Do you see how unrealistic this is?
        Given that budget, I can bundle in a SMR nuclear reactor and still have change
        left.

            spongebobstoes: my point is that cooling is not the problem, launch cost per kg
            is

ppeetteerr: Don't let common sense stop you from a good time.

OrvalWintermute: This is written by someone that is not in aerospace that thinks
terrestrially.  Engineering is always a question of tradeoffs.  Launch costs are
dropping, and we’re still using inefficient rockets. Space elevators & space
trains, among others, can drop this much more, the launch costs are still
dropping, even using rockets, maybe we’ll never get to elevators & trains the
costs will drop so low!  Radiation shielding is not required for VLEO or LEO,
and phenomenally more capable aerospace processors are near - hi Microchip Inc!
There are many other radiation solutions coming, no doubt with nuclear power.
Satellites can be upgraded at scale, though for many things, it does not make $
sense to upgrade them, but fuel , reaction wheels, solar panels, among other
things do make $ sense to replace.  Latency was technically solved in 1995 &
2001 with the first laser comms missions NASDA’s ETS-VI kiku-6 and ESA’s Artemis
, and Laser crossbars for comms are common. A full laser TDRS no RF is not yet
extant but soon. Earth to deepspace was just demonstrated by ESA.  Cooling can
be significantly improved due to lower launch costs, heat piping, RTGs, TEGs,
and thermoradiative cells, not to mention sunside solar and darkside inline
radiators  Furthermore, it is very likely that as neuromorphics with superior
SWaP emerge, we could see very different models of space based computation.
Economic tradeoffs should drive many of these decisions as I’m not discussing
the other applications of datacenter in space

    sfink: > Cooling can be significantly improved due to lower launch costs, heat
    piping, RTGs, TEGs, and thermoradiative cells, not to mention sunside solar and
    darkside inline radiators  You're saying they're going to steal the night? We'll
    see the sun in the day, radiative cooling for surveillance AI in the time
    formerly known as night?  I'll confess that the numbers aren't nearly as bad as
    I'd thought. Apparently, you can dissipate 1MW at 100°C with a 17m diameter
    sphere at night. So it's like the size of a small house. It doesn't even glow.
    On the other hand, you need a lot of temperature differential to move the heat
    out fast enough, which means your TPUs are going to be hellishly hot.  Though
    you'd probably only run it when it's in the sun and radiate in other directions,
    so you don't have to store the power in heavy batteries. You need a 56m diameter
    disk of solar panels to provide 1MW, don't forget that.  (All figures were vibe
    calculated with Claude and are unchecked.)

nickorlow: I don't get the point at all of these. You:  - have very non-
deterministic latency  - are located outside of a country that can protect you
(ie China could disrupt your space data center)  - have to pay millions of
dollars to swap out hardware

    frotaur: and : kessler syndrome

    jonshariat: And what about servicing? Last I checked these data centers don't
    run without incident and need people (or fine robots) to physically interact
    with them.

    cousinbryce: You’re also located outside of any country that could regulate

        nickorlow: A country will definitely still be able to regulate you. Also under
        what regulations they'd be afraid of other than local building laws

j45: I'm not sure datacenters in space have to make suense to everyone, or from
the perspective of earth.  Taking a creative step back, perhaps datacenters in
space support something with Mars?  As much as that might not seem realistic, I
also have to counterbalance it with operationalizing and commercializing SpaceX,
Starlink and Tesla relatively quickly when so much stays at the R&D stage for so
long.

MithrilTuxedo: I bet they can already weaponize their satellites to prevent the
launch of other satellites.  Putting data centers in space keeps them out of
reach of humans with crowbars and hammers, which may have been a vulnerability
for those robots Tesla is building.

phire: As far as I can tell, Data centres in space only seem viable because
their advocates insist on comparing them to standard terrestrial data centres.
And nobody ever calls them out on it.  Today's data centres are optimised for
reliability, redundancy, density, repairability, connectivity and latency. Most
of advertised savings come not from placing the data centre in space, but the
fact that advocates have argued away the need for absolutely everything that
modern data centres are designed to supply, except for the compute.  If they can
really build a space data centre satellite for as cheap as they claim, why
launch it? Just drive it out into the middle of the desert and dump it there. It
can access the internet via starlink, and already has solar panels for power and
radiators for cooling. IMO, If it can cool itself in direct sunlight in space,
it can cool itself in the desert.  The main thing that space gains you over
setting up the same satellite in the desert is ~23 hours of power, vs the ~12
hours of power on the ground. And you suddenly gain the ability to repair the
satellite. The cost of the launch would have to be extremely cheap before the
extra 11ish hours of runtime per day outweighed the cost of a launch; Just build
twice as many "ground satellites".  And that's with a space optimised design. We
can gain even more cost savings by designing proper distributed datacenter
elements. You don't need lightweight materials, just use steel. You can get rid
of the large radiators and become more reliant on air cooling. You can built
each element bigger, because you don't have to fit the rocket dimensions. You
could even add a wind turbine, so your daily runtime isn't dependant on daylight
hours. Might even be worth getting rid of solar and optimising for wind power
instead.  An actual ground optimised design should be able to deliver the same
functionality as the space data centre, for much cheaper costs. And it's this
ground optimised distributed design that space data centres should be compared
to, not today's datacenter which are hyper-optimised for pre-AI use cases.
-------------------  Space data centres are nothing more than a cool Sci-Fi
solution looking for a problem. There have been mumblings for years, but they
were never viable (even bitcoin mining was a bit too latency sensitive). Space
data centre advocates have been handed a massive win with this recent AI boom,
it's the perfect problem for their favourite solution to solve.  But because
it's a solution looking for a problem, they are completely blind to other
solutions that might be an even better fit.

    MagicMoonlight: You don’t even need the desert. Just put it in India and use
    coal power or whatever. AI training doesn’t care about latency to the data
    centre, so you could put it anywhere, as long as it is cheap.

        phire: I mean, I'd prefer they used some form of renewable energy.  But there
        should be plenty of options once you start actually optimising for the same use-
        case as space data centres. Many places have very predictable wind (especially
        off-shore, which gives you bonus access to cooling water). Or maybe you could
        set up small hydro power schemes along remote rivers.

            butvacuum: After the last round of this a few weeks/months ago I realized:
            Assuming the investors for this are too stupid to do the figures seen here
            themselves is folly. So, they must be factoring in something else-  Perhaps
            space based DCs allow for expansion into ITAR controlled countries and/or
            sanctioned countries/individuals.  Maybe throw in the fact that nobody can
            REALLY verify system behavior once its up there. So NSA/CIA etc sure are
            chomping at the bit to allow it.  I'm sure there's others I haven't thought of-
            probably less outlandish/tinfoily as well.

    variaga: This is the correct analysis.  Not to go all Ian Malcolm, but half this
    comment section is spending so much time wondering if we could build a space
    data center, without stopping to ask if it made any goddamn sense whatsoever to
    do so.

    rhplus: By keeping the whole thing on earth we can also reclaim the gold,
    copper, and rare earth metals when it’s financially viable to do so, rather than
    just letting them burn up on reentry.

    jujube3: The strategies used to cool something in space are not going to work at
    all in the desert. The amount of solar power you'll get in the desert is orders
    of magnitude less, and intermittent. In the desert you will have to deal with
    rain, weather, and other parts of nature.  Elon has already built tons of data
    centers here on earth. He knows how to build them quickly. People even build
    them in tents these days.

rybosworld: It seems like every argument in favor of doing this is: "yeah sure
but what if X was Y% cheaper?"  And some of us are reading these things and
trying to be polite.  But at some point patience runs thin and the only response
that breaks through the irrationality is some variation of "what if unicorns and
centaurs had teamed up with Sauron?"  The limit of the ratio of useful:useless
"what if's" approaches zero.

    NegativeK: With regards to a community, I once heard someone say that it takes
    10 "atta boy"'s to counteract 1 "you suck".  I also remember, roughly 10 years
    ago, people saying that the amount of effort to discredit bullshit is wildly out
    of whack. Which makes bullshit basically asymmetric warfare.  So here we are, in
    this thread, actually spending time attempting to discredit bullshit.

        rybosworld: Well said.

        magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it." - Brandolini's Law -

bamboozled: But it's absolutely amazing hype and memevestors love it.

gowld: What is this website?  The website insists that you let it record your
voice in order to show you the dangers of AI. Is it trolling the visitor?
https://civai.org/talk

random_duck: It seems quite telling we are even discussing this.

_DeadFred_: He's going to do a DOGE (memecoin not government agency) equivalent
over phones new satellite links to his SpaceX sats outside anyone national
jurisdiction. Worth the possibility of taking over being the world's global
currency unconnected from any/all government.

tschellenbach: Google, Spacex, several startups are all doing this. The best
people in their fields think it might be viable. I'm skeptical as well, but you
do wonder if maybe they are right and how exciting that would be.

    vineyardmike: Everyone else is announcing initiatives to investigate the
    feasibility of this because earthlings currently hate the data center build out.
    The news is full of anti-DC stories about how much electricity/water they're
    using. They're selling a story.

rolph: where do you put things, so that no one will be able to warrant thier way
into access?  entirely out of jurisdiction, where it is prohibitively expensive
to travel, and impractical for any physical seizure.  you dont need to compute,
just store it and P2P amongst satellites.  essentially an orbital NAS.

typ: Assuming that we place an iron ball (ideal sphere-shaped and thermal
conductivity) on the SSO (solar synchronous orbit), how hot can the object be?
Given the solar constant 1361 W/m^2, you can calculate the temperature range
based on the emissivity and absorptivity. With the right shape and “color”, the
equilibrium temperature can be cooler than most people thought.  I suppose that
a space data center powered 100% by solar is no different than this iron ball in
principle.

    eldenring: The ideal shape would be a shaded, flat panel perpendicular to the
    sun right?

        typ: That should be better than a sphere. Though I imagine there could be some
        fancier 3D geometry designs.  Even for a simple sphere, if we give it different
        surface roughnesses on the sun-facing side and the "night" side, it can have
        dramatically different emissivity.

    adastra22: About 120 degC.

wat10000: A thought experiment. Imagine that you had some magic way of getting
all the electricity you wanted at the south pole, you had good internet
connectivity, and the various treaties about the place weren't an issue for you.
Would you want to build a data center there?  Seems like a pretty obvious "no"
to me. Loudoun County is a much better choice, just to pick one alternative.
Antarctica is an awfully inhospitable place and running a data center there
would be a nightmare.  And yet it's way better than space. It's much easier to
get to. Cooling is about a thousand times easier. The radiation environment is
much more forgiving.  This whole concept is baffling to me.  (Incidentally, a
similar thought experiment is useful when talking about colonizing Mars. Think
about colonizing the south pole. Mars is a harsher environment in just about
every way, so take the difficulties of colonizing the south pole and multiply
them.)

xrd: Elon has used the greater fool theory for so long that they no longer exist
on earth (at least fools with money who aren't also using the greater fool
theory). It makes perfect sense he would focus on space because if he does find
aliens it'll be an entirely new investor pool for him, and he desperately needs
that now.

kabdib: Computing hardware that isn't rad-hard is going to have a bad time
without a handy atmosphere for shielding.  And hardware that is happy in high-
radiation environments is not going to be fast.

taf2: Isn't Starlink already basically a distributed datacenter in space?  they
have like  ~9k+ satellites up there already at least according to:
https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html.  what am I missing here?

    ladberg: I'd assume Starlink satellites do the minimal possible amount of
    compute required (thus power used, thus heat generated) to provide service. The
    builders of data centers are hungry for as many watts on Earth as they can
    source.

cornonthecobra: Given xAI's gross disregard for environmental regulations in
building Colossus, the reason for building datacenters in space seems obvious:
there's no EPA in space.

JumpCrisscross: > Kessler syndrome: a cascading explosion of debris crippling
our access to space  I'm taking the parts of this write-up I don't have
expertise with a grain of salt after seeig this.  Kessler cascades are real.
Particularly at high altitudes. They're less of a problem in LEO. And in no case
can they "[cripple] our access to space." (At current technology levels. To
cripple access to space you need to vaporise material fractions of the Earth's
crust into orbit.)

    alansammarone: Yep. I'm no fan of Elon - exactly the opposite, in fact - but
    this is just someone trying to look smart and eco-friendly by doing the
    simplest, least ambitious, most obvious and surface-level analysis.  The
    sentence you mention was indeed a give away, but there are many others. Worst
    case scenario, nothing works and Elon burns a bunch of money, part of which goes
    into jobs and research. Best case scenario, we actually move away from
    technologies from the 50's and end up with daily, cheap earth-to-low-orbit
    (ideally something better than that - how about the moon?), no more whining
    about energy costs, and laser communication IRL. That's just the obvious stuff.
    Being "realistic" and "having a budget" is what companies like Google do. That's
    all good, but we have enough of those already.

    marcosdumay: > Particularly at high altitudes.  Well, maybe "higher", but not
    really high.  The lower the altitude, the larger the odds of making one, in a
    quadratic fashion. But also the lower the altitude, the less time it will last.
    There is some space where it lasts basically forever but is small enough for it
    to happen. It's higher than LEO, and way lower than things like GEO.

    adastra22: SpaceX made a request of the FCC to authorize a constellation of 1
    million satellites. And these are going to be much larger, "data center"
    satellites. This many satellites, all in the same orbit (sun-synchronous is a
    specific orbit), vastly changes the math on Kessler syndrome.

quantum_state: A pie in the sky

mrandish: > Ground-based solar panels have been getting more cost effective for
decades and show no sign of slowing down.  I'm no expert on solar but I thought
there was some upper limit on how much power ground-based solar panels can
generate per area based on how much energy gets through the atmosphere all the
way to ground - and that panel efficiency was approaching that limit.  However,
I don't doubt ground-based panels can continue to improve in cost and other
metrics and thus exert competitive pressure on space-based solutions.

    dexwiz: Requirements for power still don't come close to total or practical
    surface area. If we get to that point, space collectors with microwave beams to
    the ground are viable.

    innis226: People are gettingtoo hung up on the radiator math and completely
    missing the massive input advantage of AM0 versus AM1.5. On Earth you get around
    1,000 Watts/m^2 (ideal), but in realtiy shave off 20–25% because of clouds and
    night time. In a sun-synchronous orbit, you’re pulling close to 1300 W/m^2, and
    that's 24x7. That is easily a 5x to 6x energy yield advantage per square meter
    of panel per day, and when you have that much surplus energy free from the
    vacuum, you can afford to brute-force the cooling problem by dumping massive
    wattage into active heat pumps to raise your radiator temps, effectively paying
    for the inefficiency of space cooling with the abundance of space power.

        adastra22: You do not solve a problem that is many orders of magnitude more
        difficult with a mere 5x to 6x efficiency gain.

dathinab: The really crazy thing is you don't need to know more then basic (non
Hollywood) physics to know how dump this is  1. every gram you need to send to
space is costly, a issue you don't have at ground level  2. cooling is a
catastrophe, sure space is cold, but also a vacuum, so the cooling rate is
roughly the infrared radiation rate. This means if you are not careful with the
surface of a satellite it can end up being very slowly cooked by sunlight alone
not including running any higher heat producing component (as it absorbs more
heat from sunlight then it emits, there is a reason satellites are mostly white,
silver or reflective gold in color). Sure better surface materials fix that, but
not to a point where you would want to run any heavy compute on it.  3. zero
repair-ability, most long running satellites have a lot of redundancy. Also at
least if you are bulk buying Nvidea GPGPUs on single digit Million Euro basis
it's not rare that 30% have some level of defect. Not necessary "fully broken"
but "performs less good then it should/compared to other units" kind of broken.
4. radiation/solar wind protections are a huge problem. Heck even if you run
things on earth it's a problem as long as your operations scale is large enough.
In space things are magnitudes worse.  5. every rocket lunch causes atmospheric
damage, so does every satellite evaporating on re-entry. That wasn't that
relevant in the past, but might become a problem just for keeping stuff like
Starlink running. We don't need to make it worse by putting datacenters into
space.  6. Kessler Syndrom is real and could seriously hurt humanity as a whole,
no reason to make it much more likely by putting things into space which don't
need to go there.  Last but not least, wtf would you even want to do it?  There
is zero benefit, non nada.

    adastra22: > sure space is cold  Even this isn't true. It's ~120 degC in
    daylight in LEO. It only gets cold in the shade, but a solar powered data center
    is pretty useless in the shade.

        hdgvhicv: The solar labels are in the sun. Behind them they are in the shade.

            adastra22: In close proximity, and connected to metal structures radiating &
            conducting heat at 120 degrees. You still have to expel that heat somehow, and
            route it around the spacecraft core.

                Tepix: I think stopping the heat conductivity is a solved problem - space
                telescopes manage to do this. But all in all, cooling in space remains a very
                big challenge.

                    adastra22: No, it isn’t solved. The James Webb telescope was shipped with
                    cryogenic coolant, and put in an orbit in the shadow of the moon far from the
                    radiating earth. Once it runs out in a few years, it’s done.

            DalasNoin: The energy collected from the solar panels must be converted into
            heat in the AI chips. It's really like putting the AI chips directly into the
            sun, just with extra steps. Sunlight gets transformed into electricity which
            gets transformed into heat in the chips.

            tgtweak: They actually need the entirety of the backside of the panels to cool
            them - if not they would literally burn out from the accumulated heat from being
            exposed to the sun.

    joelthelion: > The really crazy thing is you don't need to know more then basic

        graemep: That sounds like what journalists usually do. They are reporters, and
        rarely have any real knowledge of what they report.

        bravetraveler: I believe you're better served by editorials for opinion,
        journalism should be comparatively rigorous. "Musk says" is not "plans/hopes"

            joelthelion: I'd argue this is not opinion but fact. Also, articles very often
            didn't say "Musk says" but just took his word for fact, not even quoting him.
            And in the era of Trump/Musk, their practices should evolve.

            titzer: I can't tell what you're actually saying. Is "Musk says Moon is made of
            blue cheese" as a title, without pointing out the fact that the moon is not made
            of blue cheese a kind of "rigorous" reporting?  Dealing in hallways gossip is
            not the job we granted the press extra constitutional protections for.

                bravetraveler: So, don't take this the wrong way, but basically:
                https://newsliteracy.wsj.com/news-opinion  I was poorly trying to raise this
                trite distinction, asserting skepticism falls closer to Opinion than Journalism.
                The line gets more fine every day. I know. Take it up with them/their peers.
                'Rigorous' would be "Billionaire says '<crazy shit>'", not "Billionaire says
                '<crazy shit>'... and here's how we feel/think about it".

        things I discovered during my brief business career was the existence of the PR
        industry, lurking like a huge, quiet submarine beneath the news. Of the stories
        you read in traditional media that aren't about politics, crimes, or disasters,
        more than half probably come from PR firms.  Musk is running out of runway on
        his way to infinity dollars and since Tesla is slowly crumbling compared to its
        valuation, the ideas need to become crazier and crazier: humanoid robots
        tomorrow, self driving taxis tomorrow, reusable rockets going to Mars tomorrow,
        data centers in space tomorrow.  It would be fun to watch if Musk wouldn't
        funnel a lot of money that could be used for good, instead. Imagine how many
        diseases we could cure with all that money. Or feed and educate the poor. Or how
        much walkable and bikeable and ultimately liveable infrastructure we could build
        world wide. Or how fewer plastics we could use, ingest and discard if we could
        promote healthy and natural alternatives.  And techies fall for his stories

            and the mirage of billionaire competency would vanish instantly if the media

    not liking these comments that say something is "too expensive" or "too hard"
    without actually crunching the numbers to verify if it actually is. It's like
    you point out a number of completely obvious problems with the scheme and
    immediately, without any detailed analysis or expertise (I know this, because
    surely you can't have expertise in all of the problems you cited) in the said

    worked out and they will get it done. If it is impossible, then this will not
    happen, but I'm a physicist myself and I can't tell without a very involved

    In space things are magnitudes worse.  Again, it's not a question whether this
    is "problematic"; everything about putting data centers in space is. The
    question is whether, with huge amount of work and resources, they can engineer a

        straight math, and the math isn't mathing.  > I suppose they could make
        something like the International Space Station, which would get regular traffic
        back-and-forth exchanging and servicing hardware as needed.  Sure, but the ISS
        itself cost ~100 billion to build and operate - probably more, this is based on
        a ten second search query. While I'm sure launches are cheaper than ever and
        will be even cheaper in the future, it's still tens of billions to build a data
        center in space, plus you'd need astronauts, supplies, hardware, etc - all a LOT
        more expensive than the equivalent processing power on earth.  > These are
        collective problems for the whole of humanity and will not concern an individual
        actor such as Elon Musk who wants to send more satellites into space.  True, so
        we as humanity should offer resistance to plans to launch thousands of objects
        into space unless they have a clear and definite benefit. I'm not worried about
        Starlink, it's a benefit to all the areas that don't have (open) access to the
        internet and they're in low-earth orbit so they'll fall back within 5 years. But
        I just don't see the benefit in putting datacenters in space, not when it's so
        much cheaper and more viable to put them on earth.

        jodrellblank: Yes, this is the nature of Brandolini's Law.  > I would assume the
        people designing this are "very careful" with everything they put in the data
        center  Which is very nice for Musk, who can spend 30 seconds running his mouth,
        and people jump to assuming that a) it's being designed, b) by skilled people,
        c) the math and finances works out already, d) that 'completely obvious'
        problems must simply be your lying eyes, and contort themselves to put all the
        effort into defending it.  Even though Musk has a history of lying announcements
        and not being able to deliver and the 'completely obvious' problems were
        actually problems that nobody solved. Where is the 2017 full self driving car?
        Where is the Vision-over-LIDAR success? Where is the Hyperloop that "would be
        able to whisk passengers from L.A. to San Francisco in just 35 minutes"? Where
        are the 2025 orbital refuelling test flights for the Moon and Mars schedule, and
        the plans for how to keep cryogenic liquid Hydrogen cold in Space? Where was the
        "funding secured" Musk lied about for taking Tesla stock private in 2018 when
        judges found there wasn't any funding and fined him $20M? Where's the person
        Musk said in 2011 he could "put on Mars in a decade"? Where's the uncrewed Mars
        ship in 2022 he announced in 2017? The human voyage in 2024?  > "I'm a physicist
        myself"  And if someone tells you they have found a quantum zero-point free
        energy room temperature superconducting over-unity perpetual motion machine, do
        you jump to their defense because you assume the speaker must be very careful
        and smarter than everyone else? Or do you say "sounds unlikely; extraordinary
        claims require extraordinary evidence"?  > "I suppose they could make something
        like the International Space Station, which would get regular traffic back-and-
        forth exchanging and servicing hardware as needed."  The ISS cost 100-150
        billion, is "larger than a 6 bedroom house", and its solar panels can generate
        250 kW. NVidia says their AI datacenter costs $50-60 billion, needs 1GW of
        electricity, and look at the size of it: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-
        nvidia-worth-5-trillion-...  You're looking at that multiple-warehouses-
        structure which could sink the output of an entire nuclear power station, and
        going with "it would be cheaper if we launched that into space"?

    claaams: The benefit is to siphon US tax money into billionaire pockets. It's
    insanely obvious and this has been Musk's MO for like 15 years now. Hyperloop?
    That was a grift to stop public transit from expanding. Tesla robo-taxis? Still
    waiting. FSD? Still waiting. Everything he does is a monumental grift to make
    himself richer and more powerful. The man is a hollow shell of a human being and
    the only thing that makes him feel anything is more money and power.

hahahahhaah: I just purchased a sandwich I made from myself in a deal that
values me a $1tn. I plan to make toasties in space.

slackerIII: Remember what the Luddites actually did? They sabotaged the machines
that were disrupting their livelihoods. If AI is as disruptive to large numbers
of workers as some people think it will be, keep in mind it's a lot easier to
destroy a GPU that's stored on earth than one in space.  Anyone planning
expenditures as large as a modern data center thinks about all kinds of risks
(earthquakes, climate, power, etc), and so perhaps there is a premium for GPUs
that are out of the reach of your median angry unemployed guy.  (yes, this is
nuts, but I can easily imagine some fever-dream pitch meeting where Musk is
talking about it)

    int0x29: The luddites won't need to sabotage a space based GPU.  They can just
    wait for waste heat, radiation, or a good old solar storm to do it for them.
    The rest of the ground lauch infrastructure is fragile.

moomoo11: What if you just took some ketamine and tried again? Does it make
sense?

_HMCB_: Like there isn’t enough stuff floating up there already.

cdf: I was listening to a podcast featuring Gavin Baker and he went on and on
about models being defined in generations, and we will be moving from Blackwell
generation to Rubin generation soon and it will be awesome. This is not
something I know a lot about and he sounds like an expert I could learn so much
from.  Then he talked about datacenters in space and this is something I have
some appreciation for, and I immediately knew he couldnt have done much Physics,
and sure enough, I was right.  There are "experts" out there who basically have
no idea what they are talking about, "it is absolute zero in space in the
shadow!", as though radiative cooling is that effective.  And that's not even
talking about part failures. How do we replace failed parts in space? This is a
scam, but everybody is afraid to openly challenge eloquent "experts" who are
confidently wrong.

IFC_LLC: Just like an idea of using an oil-powered carriage instead of a good'ol
horsie was in 1910.  Listen, I totally agree, the tech makes absolutely no
sense. It does not. But the fact that someone is willing to spend money on
figuring this out is pretty good. The worst thing is going to happen, we'll have
a cheaper space travel. And let the guys to have the first hit at it, wasting
money on an enormous amount of research needed.  Ain't my money being spent.  As
long as we don't have to use Russian rockets to send the US payload to the
orbit, I'm cool with it.

    danny_codes: It is your money being spent. ~40B so far. Though half of that is
    for services.  But more abstractly, it's our resources that are being allocated.
    The planet as a unit is deciding where to put it's effort. Apparently we're not
    very good at this

    metabagel: I can’t take any of it seriously.

kittikitti: A more reasonable project would be repurposing portions of the ISS
for a data center and using that as a POC for larger scale stations.

7e: Data centers in space make sense when you want it to cost 200x more than on
land, be unavailable for repairs and upgrades, and be either high latency or be
out of commission during periods of darkness.

MBCook: How much of this is because putting data centers in space is WAY harder
for any terrestrial government to get their hands on and seize or block?  They
make no sense otherwise.  The only other thing I can think of is the whole thing
is just a scheme to get investment and they’re never going to actually go
through with it.  At this point I kind of think the former is more likely.

zemaj: I feel like he has no intention of implementing this. It's all just
justification for it to not hit up against an regulatory objections to combining
the companies.

elamje: I was talking to someone about this the other day. I was part of a team
at NASA that developed a cooling system for the ISS and this whole premise makes
no sense to me.  1. Getting things to space is incredibly expensive  2.
Ingress/egress are almost always a major bottleneck - how is bandwidth cheaper
in space?  3. Chips must be “Rad-hard” - that is do more error correcting from
ionizing radiation - there were entire teams at NASA dedicated to special
hardware for this.  4. Gravity and atmospheric pressure actually do wonders for
easy cooling. Heat is not dissipated in space like we are all used to and you
must burn additional energy trying to move the heat generated away from source.
5. Energy production will be cheaper from earth due to mass manufacturing of
necessary components in energy systems - space energy systems need novel
technology where economies of scale are lost.  Would love for someone to make
the case for why it actually makes total sense, because it’s really hard to see
for me!

    philipwhiuk: > Chips must be “Rad-hard” - that is do more error correcting from
    ionizing radiation - there were entire teams at NASA dedicated to special
    hardware for this.  They don't do RAD hardening on chips these days, they just
    accept error and use redundant CPUs.

        elamje: Where did you hear this?

        adastra22: You are confidently incorrect. Even Starlink uses rad-hardened CPUs.
        Redundant error correction is only really an option on launch hardware that only
        spends minutes in space.  Note that on modern hardware cosmic rays permanently
        disable circuits, not mere bitflips.

            NitpickLawyer: > You are confidently incorrect.  No, he's not. Dragon is using
            CotS, non rad-hardened CPUs. And it's rated to carry humans to space.  > AWST:
            So, NASA does not require SpaceX to use radiation-hardened computer systems on
            the Dragon?  John Muratore: No, as a matter of fact NASA doesn't require it on
            their own systems, either. I spent 30 years at NASA and in the Air Force doing
            this kind of work. My last job was chief engineer of the shuttle program at
            NASA, and before that as shuttle flight director. I managed flight programs and
            built the mission control center that we use there today.  On the space station,
            some areas are using rad-hardened parts and other parts use COTS parts. Most of
            the control of the space station occurs through laptop computers which are not
            radiation hardened.  > Q: So, these flight computers on Dragon – there are three
            on board, and that's for redundancy?  A: There are actually six computers. They
            operate in pairs, so there are three computer units, each of which have two
            computers checking on each other. The reason we have three is when operating in
            proximity of ISS, we have to always have two computer strings voting on
            something on critical actions. We have three so we can tolerate a failure and
            still have two voting on each other. And that has nothing to do with radiation,
            that has to do with ensuring that we're safe when we're flying our vehicle in
            the proximity of the space station.  I went into the lab earlier today, and we
            have 18 different processing units with computers in them. We have three main
            computers, but 18 units that have a computer of some kind, and all of them are
            triple computers – everything is three processors. So we have like 54 processors
            on the spacecraft. It's a highly distributed design and very fault-tolerant and
            very robust.  [1] - https://aviationweek.com/dragons-radiation-tolerant-design

                adastra22: > Dragon is using CotS, non rad-hardened CPUs. And it's rated to
                carry humans to space.  Those are not independent facts. They put the hardware
                inside, behind the radiation shielding they use to keep the astronauts safe.
                It's why regular old IBM laptops work on the Space Station too. That kind of
                shielding is going to blow your mass budget if you use it on these satellites.
                SpaceX, which prefers COTS components when it can use them, still went with AMD
                Versal chips for Starlink. Because that kind of high performance, small process
                node hardware doesn't last long in space otherwise (phone SoC-based cubesats in
                LEO never lasted more than a year, and often only a month or so).

                    NitpickLawyer: > They put the hardware inside,  Which is exactly how you'd do a
                    hypothetical dc in space. Come on, you're arguing for the sake of arguing. CotS
                    works. This is not an issue.  > That kind of shielding is going to blow your
                    mass budget  SpX is already leading in upmass by a large margin. Starship
                    improves mass to orbit. Again, this is a "solved" issue.  There are other
                    problems in building space DCs. Rad hardening is not one of them. AI training is
                    so fault tolerant already that this was never an issue.

                        notrealyme123: > AI training is so fault tolerant already that this was never an
                        issue.  Such nonsense.

                            NitpickLawyer: Between fp nondeterminism, fp arithmetic, async gradient updates,
                            cuda nondeterminism, random network issues, random nodes failing and so on,
                            bitflip is the last of your concerns. SGD is very robust on noise. That's why it
                            works with such noisy data, pipelines, compute and so on. Come on! This thread
                            is having people find the most weird hills to die on, while being completely off
                            base.

                        adastra22: None of the discussed designs include radiation shielding like that.
                        Nobody is considering doing it that way, because the math really really doesn’t
                        work out (instead of unshielded, where it just doesn’t work out).  A cosmic ray
                        striking a chip doesn’t cause a bitflip - it blows out the whole compute unit
                        and permanently disables it. It is more like a hand grenade going off.

                danparsonson: Carrying humans to space is not the same use case as spending long
                periods of time in orbit.

                    NitpickLawyer: Dragon spends 6mo+ in orbit regularly. I have no idea what's
                    happening in this thread, but it seems everyone is going insane. People don't
                    even know what they're talking about, but they keep on bringing bad arguments.
                    I'm out.

                        danparsonson: > Dragon spends 6mo+ in orbit regularly.  ... hooked up to the
                        ISS, with humans in attendance to fix anything that goes wrong... not doing very
                        much.  It's akin to the difference between a boat moored up in a port, and an
                        autonomous drone in the middle of the Pacific. Aside from that, satellites have
                        to maneuver in orbit (to stay in the correct orbit, and increasingly to avoid
                        other satellites). Hefting around additional kgs of shielding makes that more
                        difficult, and costly in terms of propellant, which is very important for the
                        lifetime of a satellite.

        numpad0: There are apparently rad-hard DDR4 chips these days so this is patently
        false. SpaceX used to talk a lot about substituting rad-hard components with
        triple redundant regular x86 years ago, that's true.  I think I've also seen
        someone mention that the cost and power benefit of substituting rad-hard chips
        with garden variety wean off fast once the level of redundancy goes up, and also
        it can't handle deep space radiations that just kill Earthbound chips rather
        than partially glitching them.

    kortilla: >Ingress/egress are almost always a major bottleneck - how is
    bandwidth cheaper in space?  Free space optics are much faster than data to/from
    the ground. If the training workloads only require high bandwidth between sats,
    this isn’t a real issue.

    TheDong: > Would love for someone to make the case for why it actually makes
    total sense, because it’s really hard to see for me!  Elon musk has a history of
    making improbable-sounding promises (buy a tesla now, by 2018 it will be a self-
    driving robotaxi earning money while you sleep, humanoid robots, hyperloops).
    The majority of these promises have sounded cool enough to enough people that
    the stock associated with him (TSLA) has made people literal millionaires just
    by holding onto the stock, and more and more people have bought in and thus have
    a financial interest in Musk's ventures being seen in a good light (since TSLA
    stock does not go up or down based on tesla's performance, it goes up or down
    based on the vibes of elon musk. It is not a car company stock, it is an elon
    vibes check).  The thing he's saying now pattern matches to be pretty similar,
    and so given Musk's goal is to gain money, and he gains money by TSLA and SpaceX
    stock going up, this makes perfect sense as a thing to say and even make minor
    motions towards in order to make him richer.  People will support it too since
    it pattern matches with the thing prior TSLA holders got rich off of, and so
    people will want to keep the musk vibes high so that their own $tsla holdings go
    to the moon.  Make sense now?

        adastra22: The story here is even simpler. SpaceX is going public this year.
        Elon made a monumentally shitty investment in Twitter and then poured a stupid
        amount of money into xAI at the peak of the cycle. By having SpaceX buy xAI, he
        gets to swap worthless shares in that company for more SpaceX liquidity. Simple
        as that.

            rockemsockem: Really seems silly to think that the guy with $800 billion is
            spending most of his time maximizing his money.

                z3t4: He probably have 700 billion in loans and need to pay rent

                kadoban: Welcome to billionares. If they weren't obsessed with "number go up"
                over any other consideration, they wouldn't be billionares.

                    nosianu: Billionaire money is not like money for the normal person. It is a
                    placeholder for how much influence you have on the economy - and even the state.
                    It is not just a number, as it is for people who just save a few dollars, for
                    whom it really is just a number until they withdraw money to use it. The
                    billionaire's money is not "money", it is actual working assets, and the
                    abstraction of turning this into a number does a terrible job, the result now
                    misunderstood by many. Assets being companies doing stuff mostly (holding non-
                    control-giving paper assets is different and not what being a top capitalist is
                    about, only used as an additional tool below the actual goal). Which they fully
                    control (the small investor does not even have any control worth mentioning when
                    they own shares of a public company).  They don't just play with money, they
                    play with real things! And they want to play with ever bigger real things. They
                    don't just want to improve some minor product. They want to control the fate of
                    civilization.  OT:  I hate this money view with a passion, this is what too many
                    people discussing wealth inequality issues get wrong. This is not Scrooge McDuck
                    and his money pile. Money is an abstraction, and it is misused terribly, hiding
                    what is actually going on for too many observers who then go on to discuss
                    "numbers".  That is also why the idea to "just redistribute the money of the
                    rich" is a failure. It isn't money! It is actual real complex organizations. And
                    you can't just make everything into a public company, and also, even when they
                    are, for better or worse owners don't lead like managers. Doing the socialism
                    thing (I grew up in the GDR) where everybody owns a tiny bit of everything just
                    does not work the same.  We will have to look at what those super-rich are
                    actually doing, case by individual case of ownership, not just look at some
                    abstract numbers. Sometimes concentrated control over a lot of assets is a good
                    thing, and other times it is not. Ignoring the objection of "who would control
                    that?", because right now they control themselves so it's never nobody.

                        the_other: I think you have read the "redistrubute the money" people wrong. They
                        definitely, absolutely want to reduce the power the tiny minority hold over the
                        many. That's the whole point. The money is a tool to get the work done.

                tyg13: Doesn't it just make sense though? How else would he have gotten 800
                billion dollars?

                sixQuarks: What’s silly is a bunch of so-called intelligent entrepreneurs and

                or that won’t work, by the guy who keeps doing the impossible

                    turtlesdown11: > by the guy who keeps doing the impossible  What exactly has
                    Elon done that's "impossible"? Like the Boring Company where he promised 1,000x
                    faster boring? It turned into a mile or two of a poorly routed hole with some
                    Teslas tossed down into it. He and his shills hand waved away the problem,
                    confident their brilliance would allow them to dig 1,000x faster than modern
                    commercial boring. It never happened.  The only impossible thing Elon has done
                    is make fantasy claims and real people fall for it.

                        stevage: I will definitely credit Elon with building a company that made
                        reusable self-landing rockets seem routine and boring. That was definitely
                        "impossible".  Pretty much everything else though is just vapourware.

                            kergonath: > That was definitely "impossible".  It was impossible in the sense
                            that nobody else did it before. It was not impossible as in you need to violate
                            basic laws of Physics or elementary Economics.  Before reusable rockets, the
                            idea made sense. Building a rocket is expensive; if we reuse we don’t have to
                            keep spending that money. Fundamentally, rockets are rockets. It’s not like they
                            invented anti-gravity or anything.  It’s like climbing the Everest. Before it
                            was done, it was still something people could plan and prepare for. But you’re
                            not going to climb all the way to the moon, even with oxygen bottles. It’s a
                            completely different problem to solve.  The most difficult point to argue
                            against for people who want to defend Musk’s delusions is simple economics: at
                            the end of the day, when you’ve solved  - the energy source problem (difficult
                            but probably doable);  - the radiation-resistant chips issue (we know we can do
                            it, but the resulting chip is not going be anywhere near as fast as normal GPUs
                            on Earth);  - the head dissipation problem (physically implausible, to be
                            charitable, with current GPUs, but considering that a space-GPU would have a
                            fraction of the power, it would just be very difficult);  - the satellite-to-
                            satellite communication issue, because you cannot put the equivalent of a rack
                            on a satellite, so you’d need communication to be more useful than a couple of
                            GeForces (sure, lasers, but then that’s additional moving parts, it’s probably
                            doable but still a bit of work);  - the logistics to send 1 million satellites
                            (LOL is all I can say, that’s a fair number of orders of magnitude larger than
                            what we can do, and a hell of a lot of energy to do it);  - and all the other
                            tiny details, such as materials and logistics just to build the thing.  Then,
                            you still end up with something which is orders of magnitude worse and orders of
                            magnitude more expensive than what we can already do today on Earth. There is no
                            upside.

                jnsie: Ah, this old fallacy. There are myriad examples of the rich striving to
                be richer and the powerful fighting to gain even more power. Why would it be any
                different with Musk? If anything I suspect (this is absolutely an unverifiable
                opinion; I am not stating it as fact) that Musk's driving force is to become the
                first trillionaire.

            mmustapic: Exactly, and there needs to be some economic justification for a
            giant rocket. There is no money to be made by going to Mars, and AI data centers
            in space could attract investors (who are just riding the data center hype).

                fsloth: > I data centers in space could attract investors (who are just riding
                the data center hype).  I find this to be the most obvious game plan here. Makes
                total sense from financial engineering point of view.  You _might_ get to
                develop nice tech/IP to enable other space based businesses at the same time.
                "we sold them on X but delivered Y". So it's a bit of a hail mary, but makes
                total sense to me if you want to have a large budget for inventing the future.
                Once you can demonstrate even a fraction of this capability of operations ... I
                think you can sell a "space dominance" offering to Pentagon for example and just
                keep pedaling.  "We are going to build the perfect weapon" does not necessarily
                entice as large engineer population as "we are going to Star Trek".  Another
                thing - if Moon is going to be a thing, then _properties on Moon_ are going to
                be a thing.  In theories of value in post-ai societies scarce assets like land
                are going to become more valuable. So it's a long term plan that makes sense if
                you believe Moon will be a realestate market.

        randomNumber7: Yeah, but landing a rocket backwards also sounded very improbable
        to me, yet it looks pretty cool now.  Also people made fun of tesla that it will
        never be able to compete with the big carmakers. Now I would rather have some
        stocks in tesla than holding on to volkswagen.

            thephyber: I wouldn’t be so sure about Tesla stock. Tesla has only weathered 1
            market downturn cycle and that was when it was a very different company. The
            company has thus far had access to plentiful capital since the Model S started
            being delivered.  Famous investors like to repeat the quote that “when the tide
            goes out, that’s when we find out who’s wearing no pants.” When Tesla actually
            weathers its first market downturn is when we find out how much investors
            interest is maintained When investment dollars are scarce.

        sixQuarks: Oh no! He promised my car would be self driving in 2018 but it took
        until 2026 before that was true.  How dare he not have accurately predicted when
        one of the hardest technical problems in history is solved?

            testing22321: “At SpaceX we specialize in making the impossible merely late.”
            -Elon

    greengrassi: When they talk about "space" they are, right now, talking about the
    moon.  Which has some gravity.  They are putting the data centers on the moon.
    And the satellites are lunar satellites not earth-orbit satellites. Lonestar
    physical data center payload landed on the moon in Feb 2025 and Sidus space
    developing the lunar satellites.

        adastra22: They are not. xAI/SpaceX is talking about millions of satellites in
        sun-synchronous orbit.

            nosianu: Yeah, the cost of doing it on the moon would be even more astronomical.
            Then there also is the three second of round-trip latency to consider (ca. 2.6 s
            just the signal, but processing adds a bit more).

    mike_hearn: It sounds hard but it shouldn't not make sense.  1. Solving cost of
    launching mass has been the entire premise of SpaceX since day one and they have
    the track record.  2. Ingress/egress aren't at all bottlenecks for inferencing.
    The bytes you get before you max out a context window are trivial, especially
    after compression. If you're thinking about latency, chat latencies are already
    quite high and there's going to be plenty of non-latency sensitive workloads in
    future (think coding agents left running for hours on their own inside
    sandboxes).  3. This could be an issue, but inferencing can be tolerant to
    errors as it's already non-deterministic and models can 'recover' from bad
    tokens if there aren't too many of them. If you do immersion cooling then the
    coolant will protect the chips from radiation as well.  4. There is probably
    plenty of scope to optimize space radiators. It was never a priority until now
    and is "just" an engineering problem.  5. What mass manufacture? Energy
    production for AI datacenters is currently bottlenecked on Siemens and others
    refusing to ramp up production of combined cycle gas turbines. They're
    converting old jet engines into power plants to work around this bottleneck.
    Ground solar is simply not being considered by anyone in the industry because
    even at AI spending levels they can't store enough power in batteries to ride
    out the night or low power cloudy days. That's not an issue in space where the
    huge amount of Chinese PV overproduction can be used 24/7.

        FranklinJabar: > There is probably plenty of scope to optimize space radiators.
        It was never a priority until now and is "just" an engineering problem.  Well,
        it's a physics problem. The engineering solution is possibly not cost efficient.
        I'd put a lot of money that it isn't.

            bborud: That bit reminded me of someone who wanted us to design a patch the size
            of a small postage stamp, at most 0.2mm thick, so you could stick on products.
            It was to deliver  power for two years of operation, run an LTE modem, a GNSS
            receiver, an MCU, temperature and humidity sensor and would cost $0.10. And it
            would send back telemetry twice per day.

                jacquesm: 'A mere matter of engineering'.

                    verzali: All you need to do is make use of a higher dimension to pack stuff
                    into. And then mass produce to bring costs down. How hard can that be?

                        bborud: Skippy the Magnificent will solve this for us.  (reference to a
                        character in the Expiditionary Force series by Craig Alanson  Only a very small
                        portion of his physical presence is in local spacetime, with the rest in higher
                        spacetime. He can expand his physical presence from the size of an oil drum or
                        shrink to the size of a lipstick tube. He can’t maintain that for long without
                        risking catastrophic effects. If he did, he would lose containment, fully
                        materialize in local spacetime and occupy local space equal to one quarter the
                        size of Paradise. The resulting explosion would eventually be seen in the
                        Andromeda Galaxy.)

                    bborud: The conversation went something like this (from memory):  - We can't do
                    that  - Why not?  - Well, physics for one.  - What do you mean?  - Well, at the
                    very least we need to be able to emit enough RF-energy for a mobile base station
                    to be able to detect it and allow itself to be convinced it is seeing valid
                    signaling.  - Yes?  - The battery technology that fits within your constraints
                    doesn't exist.  Nevermind the electronics or antenna.  - Can't you do something
                    creative?  We heard you were clever.  I distinctly remember that last line.  But
                    I can't remember what my response was.  It was probably something along the
                    lines of "if I were that clever I'd be at home polishing my Nobel medal in
                    physics".  Even the sales guy who dragged me into this meeting couldn't keep it
                    together.  He spent the whole one hour drive back to the office muttering "can't
                    you do something creative" and then laughing hysterically.  I think the solution
                    they went for was irreversible freeze and moisture indication stickers.  Which
                    was what I suggested they go for in the first 5 minutes of the meeting since
                    that a) solved their problem, and b) is on the market, and c) can be had for the
                    price point in bulk.

                        jacquesm: That's so hilarious. I've had a couple that went in that direction but
                        nothing to come close.  To be fair though, there is a lot of tech that to me
                        seems like complete magic and yet it exists. SDR for instance, still has me
                        baffled. Who ever thought you'd simply digitize the antenna signal and call it a
                        day, hardware wise, the rest is just math, after all.  When you get used to
                        enough miracles like that without actually understanding any of it and suddenly
                        the impossible might just sound reasonable.  > Can't you do something creative?
                        We heard you were clever.  Should be chiseled in marble.

                            bborud: The purely digital neighborhood of the SDRs is much easier to explain
                            than the analog rat droppings between the DAC/ADC and the antenna. That part
                            belongs to dark wizards with costly instruments that draw unsettling polar
                            plots, and whose only consistent output is a request for even pricier gear from
                            companies whose names sound an awful lot like European folk duos.  The digital
                            end of SDRs are simple. Sample it, then once you have trapped the signal in
                            digital form beat the signal into submission with the stick labeled "linear
                            algebra".  (Nevermind that the math may be demanding.  Math books are nowhere
                            near as scary as the Sacred Texts Of The Dark Wizards)  "Rohde & Schwarz — live
                            at the VNA, 96 dB dynamic range, one night only."

                                jacquesm: > whose names sound an awful lot like European folk duos.  That had me
                                laughing out loud, you should have left the name out to make it more of a
                                puzzler :)  I apparently have been drawn to the occult for a long time and feel
                                more comfortable with coils, capacitors and transmission lines than I do with
                                the math behind them. Of course it's great to be able to just say 'ridiculously
                                steep bandpass filter here' and expect it to work but I know that building that
                                same thing out of discrete components - even if the same math describes it -
                                would run into various very real limitations soon.  And here I am on a budget
                                SDR speccing a 10 Hz bandfilter and it just works. I know there must be some
                                downside to this but for the life of me I can't find it.

                        klaff: I like your sales guy. Might have punched them after a while but that's
                        right up there with the time someone tried to tell me there was no iron in steel
                        because it wasn't in the ingredients list. And this someone sold stamped steel
                        parts!

            Ajedi32: What makes you so sure? SpaceX already has thousands of 6 kW networking
            racks flying around in LEO and they dissipate their heat just fine, and are
            plenty cost-effective. You think they can't do any better than that with a new
            design specifically optimized for computing rather than networking?

                verzali: Probably, but they likely can't do better than we can do on Earth.
                Networking in space offers specific advantages that are not easy to replicate on
                Earth. Data centers in space don't have clear advantages beyond easily debunked
                ideas about cooling and power.

                    Ajedi32: I'm not talking about the whole idea, just the heat dissipation part.
                    So many people in this thread seem so sure this is impossible because you can't
                    radiate heat in space, completely ignorant to the fact that SpaceX is already
                    dissipating over 20 MW of solar power in LEO in a reasonably cost-effective
                    manner.  The advantage of 24/7 solar power is clear, obvious, and undeniable,
                    it's just a question of whether that's outweighed by the other disadvantages.

                undersuit: The solar panels on the newest satellites can deliver 6kW but the
                power that satellite actually uses is less. The satellite is only using 300W[1]
                during the dark phase of it's orbit when it can use it's entire mass to cool
                down. Is that limit because of the battery or is it because the satellite needs
                to radiate all the heat it acquired from the other half of the time in the sun?
                [1] https://lilibots.blogspot.com/2020/04/starlink-satellite-dim...

                    Ajedi32: Looks like that's a purely speculative assumption the blog author made,
                    not a fact. I'm not sure why he made that assumption given that Starlink doesn't
                    actually stop working at night.  Fair point that in SSO you'd need 2-3x the
                    radiator area (and half the solar panels, and minimal/no batteries). I don't
                    think that invalidates my point though.

                        undersuit: Article doesn't say the satellites stop working in their dark phase,
                        it says they consume 300W in the dark phase based on some battery math.

            drtz: Not only is it not cost-effective, it's pointless (in this context).
            Radiators works almost just as well on Earth. Convection and conduction more
            than make up the difference.

        haspok: > There is probably plenty of scope to optimize space radiators. It was
        never a priority until now and is "just" an engineering problem.  It's a physics
        problem, as others pointed out, but even if we take it as another "just an
        engineering problem", have a look at the Hyperloop. Which is similarly just a
        long vacuum tube, and inside is like an air hockey table, not that big a deal,
        right?...

            mike_hearn: Musk's companies never tried to make the hyperloop, they never even
            started on it. SpaceX is a bit different.

                diabllicseagull: so spacex worked on an orbital data center?

                    Rover222: no, just merely more satellites than the rest of the world combined,
                    with the first functioning laser links in a large constellation.

        monooso: I have no expertise is this area, so I'm not getting into whether or
        not this idea makes sense.  That being said, this statement strikes me as
        missing the point:  > Solving cost of launching mass has been the entire premise
        of SpaceX since day one and they have the track record.  As I understand it,
        SpaceX has a good track record of putting things into space more cost
        effectively than other organisations that put things into space.  That is not
        the benchmark here.  It doesn't matter if Musk can run thousands of data centres
        in space more cost effectively than (for example) NASA could. It matters whether
        he can do it more cost effectively than running them on earth.

            mike_hearn: The cost of "launching" mass on Earth is not zero, though.

                monooso: I didn't suggest that it was.

            tfehring: I don’t think that statement was missing the point. As you point out,
            what matters is the total cost of ownership of the system. The cost of launching
            mass into space today isn’t the only reason terrestrial data centers are more
            cost effective today, but it’s the main one. If you make it cheap enough to send
            giant solar arrays and radiators to space, the other costs of operating in space
            may start to look like a small price to pay to eliminate the need for inputs
            like land and batteries.

        clysm: 3. There are WAY more things to get corrupted on a computer system than
        tokens. And non-determinism does NOT mean it’s tolerant to faults. Random values
        are intentionally introduced at the right moment for LLMs.

        drtz: > It sounds hard but it shouldn't not make sense.  It does not make sense.
        The question isn't "can you mitigate the problems to some extent?", it's "can
        you see a path to making satellite data centers more appealing than
        terrestrial?"  The answer is a flat out "no," and none of your statements
        contradict this.  Terrestrial will always be better:  1. Reducing the cost of
        launches is great, but it will never be as cheap as zero launches.  2. Radio
        transmissions have equally high bandwidth from Earth, but fiber is a better
        network backbone in almost every way.  3. Radiation events don't only cause
        unpredictable data errors, they can also cause circuit latch-ups and cascade
        into system failure. Error-free operation is still better in any case. Earth's
        magenetosphere and atmosphere give you radiation shielding for free, rad-hard
        chips will always cost more than standard (do they even exist for this
        application?), and extra shielding will always cost more than no shielding.  4.
        On Earth you can use conduction, convection, AND radiation for cooling. Space
        only gets you marginally more effective radiation.  5. Solar is cheaper on the
        ground than in space. The increase in solar collection capability per unit area
        in space doesn't offset the cost of launch: you can get 20kW of terrestrial
        solar collection for around the price of a single 1U satellite launch, and that
        solar production can be used on upgraded equipment in the future. Any solar you
        put on a satellite gets decommissioned when the inference hardware is obsolete.
        And this ignores other issues like hardware upgrades, troubleshooting, repairs,
        and recycling that are essentially impossible in space, but are trivial on the
        ground.

        catoc: “just an engineering problem”  Sounds a bit like that Dilbert where the
        marketing guy has sold a new invisible computer and is telling the engineers to
        now do their job and actually make it.

        danans: > Solving cost of launching mass has been the entire premise of SpaceX
        since day one and they have the track record.  They have to solve for it being
        cheaper to launch and operate in space vs building and operating a datacenter
        with its own power generation on Earth.

        Rover222: My lord a sensible comment her. A hearty upvote.

            estimator7292: It really isn't. It's plainly incorrect and ignorant of the
            actual problems.

    energy123: > 5. Energy production will be cheaper from earth  Sun-synchronous
    orbit means solar panels collect the same amount 24/7. I guess that's the #1
    benefit. Cheap energy.

        donkey_brains: Read the whole sentence. He’s talking about the cost to make
        solar panels that can be deployed in space, not the efficacy of said panels.

    Symmetry: Regarding 3, they're almost certainly thinking of putting these in SSO
    where the radiation environment isn't too much worse than you see on the ISS.
    If they were going to go outside the Van Allen belts it would be a different
    story.

    matthewdgreen: The whole AI bubble makes way more sense if you model it not as
    rational economic activity, but rather as the actions of a rogue AI slowly
    taking over our institutions and redirecting them towards its goals. Data
    centers in space make no sense economically, but think of how survivable the
    rogue AI will be once we build those orbiting data centers! (I am joking about
    this, but it's weird that my logic makes sense.)

    tgtweak: Added some math on my comment that outlines the boundaries of economics
    of this considering most of what you mentioned.

    mghackerlady: for the chips to both be radiation hardened and as powerful as our
    current chips they'd need to be massive. There's a reason the mars rover uses a
    PowerPC G3

    UltraSane: It doesn't make sense. It is just Musk trying to pump up SpaceX
    valuation before the IPO.

gordian-mind: Three counterpoints:  1) Kessler syndrome is a contingency.  2)
This is a logistics issue, not a physical impossibility.  3) Those are different
tradeoffs (solar in space). There is not really an argument there.  All in all
this is extremely weak reasoning, which is quite the contrast with the
definitive title.  I throw this to the "nerds need to feel smarter than Elon"
pile of articles. :)

Zanni: Electric cars make no sense.  Reusable rockets make no sense.  Autonomous
cars make no sense.  Data centers in space make no sense. <--- You are here.
Humanoid robots make no sense.

    jeltz: Hyperloop: makes no sense  Solar roof tiles: makes no sense  Lot's of
    tiny tunnels under cities: makes no sense  Performance of the new roadster:
    makes no sense  All four of the above were likely scams. Musk is not beyond
    running a scam.

    oblio: Cherry picking makes no sense.

    jodrellblank: - Electric motors were invented in 1827 and one of the first
    things the inventor did was a toy electric car in 1827. The first proper
    electric car was 1890, and they were popular as golf carts and milk floats
    through the 1900s. What they were lacking was good enough batteries. -

briandw: Eager Space [Orbital Data Centers Yes or
No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAcR7kqOb3o) Goes into great detail with
extensive calculations (for a YT video at least). TLDR: Cost to orbit needs to
be under $200/kg before it makes sense.

reilly3000: I always thought that in the case of a rouge AI breakout that we
could just cut the power or network. This makes both impossible. The sick genius
of SkyNet was having the most defensible infrastructure when it became clear
that whoever controls the biggest robot army can take out enemy data centers and
control the world. Now I hope that shooting down LEO satellites is cheap and
DIY-able.  I think it’s all farce and technically unsound, but I also think that
grok-5-elononly is a helluva drug. It’s really got him ready to rally investors
behind “spreading the light of consciousness to the universe”. Oh to see the
chat logs of their (Elon and his machine girlfriend)’s machinations.

benl: Data centers in space may or may not make sense (personally I'm quite
skeptical) but the objections in the article certainly don't make sense.  1. The
only reason there are 15,000 satellites in space is because SpaceX launched
about 9,500 of them (Starlink is 65% of all satellites) on their semi-reusable
Falcon 9. If fully-reusable Starship pans out, they will be launching satellites
at 10x the rate of Falcon 9 at the very least.  2. You don't need to upgrade the
satellites, you just launch new ones. The reason data center companies upgrade
their servers is because they can't just build a new data center to hold the new
chips. But satellites in space are a sunk cost, so just keep using the existing
satellites while also launching new ones.  3. Falling solar panel costs
decreases the power costs for both earth-based and space-based, but they're more
efficient in space so the benefit would be proportionally greater there.  As I
said, I'm skeptical too, but let's be skeptical for good reasons.

    audunw: 3. The falling costs won’t benefit space as much. The cost of sending
    mass to space will still be a big factor in the space solar panel costs. Much of
    the reason why solar is getting cheaper is not the panels themselves, but due to
    innovations that reduce installation costs. Those don’t apply to space (outside
    of the already assumed reductions in sending mass to space to make this viable)

        benl: Yes, launch cost is the crux of the matter. My skepticism is based on
        whether they’ll be able to get launch cost low enough and launch cadence high
        enough. SpaceX has shown the ability to get launch costs dramatically lower and
        cadence dramatically higher, but it’s not a slam dunk that those curves will
        continue to the levels needed for this idea to work.

    jraby3: A few additional items to rebut the lack of info in this Article:  -
    SpaceX just requested a license to launch up to a million satellites.  - the
    satellites already have some incredible anti collision software, which I believe
    Elon has now open sourced.  - the cost to launch 1 kg to space has dropped by a
    factor of 10 in the past few years and is currently less than $1000. It's
    perfectly reasonable to estimate that over the next 10 years the cost could drop
    by another factor of 10, if not more, particularly if the heavy rockets are
    reusable.  1. https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/31/spacex-seeks-federal-appro...

    item 3

        estomagordo: Elon has open sourced them, or the people at SpaceX who actually
        know or understand something did?

            indoordin0saur: Open sourcing your company's secret sauce is probably the sort
            of decision that only the CEO approves.

    ZiiS: 2) it is extremely common to add storage to existing servers. Only
    slightly less; RAM, CPUs etc. not to mention how often it is cost-effective to
    replace broken components.

JackYoustra: Data centers in space make sense because its nigh impossible to
build things terrestrially. NIMBYism is so out of control the largest solar
array in the US in the middle of the mojave got cancelled because it would
interfere with the view.  "Just change the law" ok sure we'll get right on it.

perfmode: Current analysis shows space-based compute costs roughly 3x more per
watt than terrestrial equivalents, requiring launch costs to fall below $200/kg
before achieving economic parity—a threshold unlikely before the mid-2030s even
with Starship’s full reusability.  While technically not impossible, the space
data center vision appears primarily designed to support SpaceX’s anticipated
mid-2026 IPO and justify a $1.5 trillion valuation rather than solve near-term
compute constraints.

    jodrellblank: How can there ever ever be economic parity between (doing x) and
    (doing x + launching x into space) ?

monocasa: Another thing that doesn't make sense about them is that DCs get a lot
of out of physical locality.  Caches become hot as different use case spin up
and down during the day near their customers.  If the nodes are spinning around
the earth at orbital velocities, then all the benefits of physical locality are
thrown out the window.

    condensedcrab: But apologists would say that putting the data centers in LEO
    would mean that latency to a client via a ground station wouldn't be much more
    than ~50 ms extra. At least LATAM and Africa would be getting a good deal out of
    it with better coverage.

sinuhe69: As the focus here is solely on the US, and the comments focus too much
on the impossibility of heat dissipation, I want to include some information to
broaden the perspective.  - In the EU, the ASCEND study conducted in 2024 by
Thales Alenia Space found that data center in space could be possible by 2035.
Data center in space could contribute to the EU's Net-Zero goal by 2050 [1]  -
heat dissipation could be greatly enhanced with micro droplet technology, and
thereby reducing the required radiator surface area by the factor of 5-10  -
data center in space could provide advantages for processing space data, instead
of sending them all to earth. - the Lonestar project proved that data storage
and edge processing in space (moon, cislunar) is possible.  - A hybrid
architecture could dramatically change the heat budget:   + optical connections
reduce heat    + photonic chips (Lightmatter and Q.ANT)   + processing-in-memory
might reduce energy requirement by 10-50 times  I think the hybrid architecture
could provide decisive advantages, especially when designed for AI inference
workloads,  [1] https://ascend-horizon.eu/

    adastra22: > micro droplet technology  Intentionally causing Kessler Syndrome?
    > A hybrid architecture could dramatically change the heat budget: + optical
    connections reduce heat + photonic chips (Lightmatter and Q.ANT) + processing-
    in-memory might reduce energy requirement by 10-50 times  It would also make
    ground-based computation more efficient by the same amount. That does nothing to
    make space datacenters make sense.

        rockemsockem: Kessler syndrome is only a problem if the satellites are in LEO.
        They don't have to be.

            adastra22: They do have to be if they want to be approved by the FCC.  And btw
            Kessler syndrome applies to any orbital band. You've got the logic backwards.
            Kessler syndrome is usually only considered a threat for LEO because that's
            where most of the satellites are. But if you're throwing million(s) of
            satellites into orbit, it becomes an issue at whatever orbital height you pick.

                jraby3: https://starlink.com/updates/stargaze

                    philipwhiuk: Is sort of somewhat handling 10,000 by enabling them to make
                    orbital adjustments more quickly. By the time you have a million, you will run
                    out of prop way too quick.

    typ: > reduce energy requirement by 10-50 times  This is only relevant to the
    compute productivity (how much useful work it can produce), but it's irrelevant
    to the heat dissipation problem. The energy income is fundamentally limited by
    the solar facing area (x 1361 W/m^2). So the energy output cannot exceed it,
    regardless useful signals or just waste heat. Even if we just put a stone there,
    the equilibrium temperature wouldn't be any better or worse.

    zbentley: > Data center in space could contribute to the EU's Net-Zero goal by
    2050  How unbelievably crass. "Let's build something out of immense quantities
    of environmentally-destructive-to-extract materials and shoot it into space on
    top of gargantuan amounts of heat and greenhouse gas emissions; since it won't
    use much earth-sourced energy once it's up there, that nets out to a win!"
    Insane.

        indoordin0saur: Blue Origin at least runs its rockets on hydrogen whose exhaust
        is only water.

            fuzzfactor: Where do they get the hydrogen without putting a load of CO2 into
            the atmosphere just to manufacture the hydrogen to begin with?  One thing to
            think about is debt which is not in terms of money.  People are becoming more
            familiar with "technical debt" since otherwise it comes due by surprise.  With
            hamsterwheels in space you've got energy debt.  Separate from all other forms of
            debt that are involved.  Like financial debt, which is only a problem if you
            can't really afford to do the project so you have to beg, borrow, and/or steal
            to get it going.  On that point I think I'd be a little skeptical if the richest
            known person can't actually afford this easily.  Especially if he really wants
            it with all his heart, and has put in any worthwhile effort so far.  Anyway,
            solar cells are kind of weak when you think about it, they don't produce the
            high output of a suitable chemical reaction, like the kind that launches the
            rockets themselves.  Which releases so much energy so fast that it's always
            going to take a serious amount of time for the "little" solar cells to have
            finally produced an equal amount of energy before a net positive can begin to
            accrue.  Keeping the assets safely on the home planet simply provides a jump-
            start that can not be matched.  All other things being unequal or not.

            zbentley: And heat and pressure. Negligible amounts in terms of the biosphere,
            but not in terms of flora and fauna in proximity to launch sites.

quirkot: What? A pump and dump scheme? I am shocked I tell you, shocked

dumbfounder: You can debate this until you are blue in the face. If the costs
are less they will do it. If they aren’t they won’t do it. That’s the only sense
that needs to be made.

    TheDong: Ah, yes, the "efficient market hypothesis", it's well known that no
    company has ever gone bankrupt because every company only does things that are
    optimally efficient and profitable.  No company has ever made an investment in
    something that ended up being more expensive than calculated, or so expensive it
    bankrupted them.

        dumbfounder: You are assuming they will commit to the solution and ride it to
        their grave trying to make it work. They will experiment and figure out a way to
        make it cheaper, or they will give up. They have plenty of money to experiment
        with this.

wewewedxfgdf: This makes the same amount of sense as colonising Mars.

yazaddaruvala: I’m surprised everyone is worried about heat dissipation.
Datacenters in space is ambiguous enough to mean on lunar soil which provides
plenty of heat dissipation using geothermal heat pumps.  Similarly mass to orbit
is also less problematic if silicon factories (including the refineries) are
built on lunar soil as well.

    adastra22: They have filed actual plans with the FCC for their satellite
    constellation. They are not talking about lunar data centers.

Jabrov: What jurisdiction does a data center in space fall under, anyway? The
one of the nation that launched it?

andsoitis: Data centers on earth alone don't make sense if we want to expand
further into the galaxy.

notepad0x90: Two reasons why it makes sense (really really good reasons):  1)
Water scarcity and energy scarcity here on earth  2) It will drive down launch
costs and promotes investment in orbital facilities and launch capabilities.
those two reasons alone are enough.

    adastra22: What does water scarcity have to do with anything? Data centers don't
    use water. They slightly heat it, and then it flows back out to whatever it
    would have done anyway.

        notepad0x90: They need fresh water which is scarce unlike salt water, once they
        use it, it can't be used for anything else. They're competing with water
        supplies of municipalities these days. Not a big deal if you're near the great
        lakes or the missisipi, but a big deal in california, arizona, utah,etc.. and
        that's just the US. There are places that are becoming unlivable because of
        water supply issues, and datacenters are needing to be built near them.

            adastra22: > once they use it, it can't be used for anything else  This is not
            true!

colordrops: What if they diverted a decent sized asteroid into earth orbit and
put the data center onto that? Could it be put into a sun-synchronous orbit,
cover one side with solar cells, and use the backside of the asteroid itself for
cooling?

numpad0: no, no, no, the key enabler to space datacenter is complete out-of-
world computer 3D printers. You print entire 130nm, hell, even 130 micrometer
GPUs and DDR2 VRAMs to go with, entirely on the Moon solely from Moon dusts, and
shoot the complete satellites out into Earth LEO using maglev sleds. PUEs, opex,
nothing matter because the Moon factory is self contained and don't interact
with Earthian economy at all. The ssh key into the factory will be the source to
free money to whoever holding it.  Is that possible in our lifetime? I'd be
optimistic about that. Can SpaceX pull that off? Space what? ...

stevep98: Surely, the question is: how big do the radiators have to be?  gemini
says that the NVIDIA DGX H100 is 130kg and takes 11kW.  It says space-based
radiators in the 100kW range are approx 15kg per kW. And space-based solar
panels are approx 1kg per kW.  So let's says we're talking about 1 system that
bundles 9 DGX H100's. That's 1.2T for the computing system,  1.5T for the
radiator, 100kg for the solar panels, and let's say 2T for the propulsion,
propellant, guidance, and all the other spacecraft stuff.   That's a total of
about 5T, and the radiator is just about 20% of the mass budget.  The power
radiated is proportional to the 4th power of the temperature, so they would be
incentivized to develop a heat exchanger with a high temperature working fluid.

    vjk800: I would assume that the current GPU systems are not optimized for
    weight. I would also assume that they need to build special purpose GPU
    equipment for space, which  could possibly be made much lighter than the current
    ones.

HardCodedBias: Of course it makes sense.  The regulatory framework is getting
more and more difficult for data centers.  The options are move to countries
with less of an uphill regulatory burden (UAE?), but this comes with other
issues.  Space it is.

utopcell: I thought chips need to be radiation-hardened to work in space.

alfiedotwtf: The article kind of ended all of a sudden without much of a
conclusion… but as most people by now have realised once they heard of the
merging of Musk and Musk, it sounds more likely just a way of shifting money to
pay himself rather than to actually build anything he says.  I’d even bet that
when they do IPO, there will be ZERO mention of “space data centres” in the
prospectus!

foxglacier: It makes a misleading argument about the price of solar panels
falling. The cost of solar power installations has been flat for a decade
because it's dominated by other costs.  Also why talk about training not
inference? That needs data centers too and could be what they're intending to
do.  So this post is clearly not an effort to objectively work out the
feasibility but just a biased list of excuses to support the author's
unsubstantiated opinion.

seydor: That's the point. Nonsensical ideas (like humans on mars) drive
valuations higher. There is not even a point to argue about practical matters.

Juliate: If someone had the tech to cool stuff in space, that is required for
this to happen, they’d have tons of easier and more lucrative opportunities
right now on Earth to become the new richest person.  Where is the tech?

yawniek: I think what many people miss is that energy became far less location
dependent if you put compute next to its generation. The latency for token
generation is not so important. So the ratios between energy consumed, bandwidth
and latency would in theory favour building dark token factories in remote but
optimal locations. But i guess construction and logistics are an issue.

exe34: "Let him cook" makes so much sense here.

gostsamo: AI in space makes no sense because the data center will be distributed
and half of the time your processors will be waiting for data (if you are
lucky). When they are working, you need to cool them down. When they finally
heed the call of gravity, your vibe coders can see the vapor of their work in
the sky and you throw the entire unit as a loss (might be a net positive for tax
purposes).  This is BS, everyone knows that this is BS, but because this is
Elon, there are still people who don't call out the BS.  It might be
distraction, he might be delusional, he might be asking his investors to stop
asking for profit by giving them shares from SpaceX, but this is not him
discovering new physics.

estomagordo: I agree with the author and the bit about xAI and investors makes
sense. But why does a company like Google invest in this ridiculous idea?

PunchyHamster: Let's do some napkin math on it  Current satellites get around
150W/kg from solar panels. Cost of launching 1kg to space is ~$2000, so we're at
$13.3(3)/Watt, that just power, let's assume that cooling will cost us same per
kg, the same amount need to be dissipated so let's round it to $27  One NVidia
GB200 rack is ~120kW. To just power it, you need to send $3 240 000 worth of
payload into space. Then you need to send additional $3 106 000 (rack of them is
1553kg) worth of servers. Plus some extra for piping. We're already at $6.3 mil
a pop for just hauling it up to orbit, with no cost of solar cells included  I'd
imagine comparable hardware for just some solar + batteries on ground is around
$200k. I dunno where the repeated 5x cost number comes from. I suspect whoever
pushed it was just lying

abalone: There are plenty of legit concerns here about e.g. the launch
externalities which are actually greater than the launch costs themselves, i.e.
climate impact to future generations.  However one flaw in this critique is that
is only looks at the cost of ground-based solar panels and not their overall
scalability. That is, manufacturing cost is far from the only factor. There is
also the need for real estate in areas with good sun exposure that also have
sufficient fresh water supply for cleaning.  When we really consider the
challenges of deploying orders of magnitude more terrestrial solar, it really
requires a more detailed and specific critique of the orbital vision. Positive
includes near continuous solar exposure (in certain orbits) and no water
requirements.  Much has been said of cooling but remember, there is a lot of
literal space between the satellites for radiative cooling fins. It is
envisioned they would network via optical links, and each mini satellite would
be roughly on the order of a desktop GPU (not a whole data center rack). The
vision is predicated on leveraging a ton of space for lots of mini satellites on
the order of a Dell desktop tower. The terrestrial areas that are really cold
are also not that great for solar exposure.  Personally I don't know how it will
play out but the core concern I have about making these kinds of absolutist
predictions is they make weak assumptions about the sustainable scalability of
terrestrial power. And that is definitely the case here in that it only looks at
the manufacturing cost of solar.

    worldsayshi: > There is also the need for real estate in areas with good sun
    exposure that also have sufficient fresh water supply for cleaning.  Solar
    panels are 20x more efficient than growing corn for ethanol. Swap out some of
    those 30 million acres of ethanol corn fields (in the US) and you'll have more
    energy than you need.  More details here:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQ9nt2ZeGM

        rswail: Utility scale PV farms should be seen as literally harvesting solar
        power, not generating it, while still allowing other agriculture like sheep
        grazing to occur using the same fields.  You plant a PV panel and add its
        irrigation (power interconnect) and remote monitoring, then you harvest power
        for the next 25+ years.  Ethanol production excess is a specific US problem
        because of the misalignment of incentives and lobbying.

        abalone: I’m all for it — converting just a third of that land to solar would be
        enough to power the grid in terms of raw output — but there is still a huge,
        unsolved problem of energy storage that scale. Without that you’re only powering
        your data center for five hours a day.

jtrn: This sentence proves the author has no ability for logical thinking: Data
centers in space only make sense if they are cost effective relative to normal
data centers.  I too don't think it's currently a sensible solution. But the
author completely unable to make a proper case. For instance, just to refute
that one claim, there are many reasons to do it in space even at an cost.
Space-based data centers provide an off-world backup that is immune to Earth-
specific disasters like earthquakes, floods, fires, or grid collapses. Servers
in orbit are physically isolated from terrestrial threats, making them safe from
riots, local warfare, or physical break-ins.  Moving infrastructure to space
solves local community disputes by removing the strain on residential power
grids and freeing up land for housing or nature. Space data centers do not
deplete Earth’s freshwater supply for cooling, unlike terrestrial centers which
consume billions of gallons annually.  Solar panels in orbit can access high-
intensity sunlight 24 hours a day without interference from clouds, night, or
the atmosphere.  Data stored in space can exist outside of national borders,
protecting it from seizure, censorship, or the legal jurisdiction of unstable
governments. Data transmission can be faster in space because light travels
roughly 30% faster in a vacuum than it does through fiber optic cables.
Processing data directly in orbit is necessary for satellites and future space
stations to avoid the delay and cost of beaming raw data back to Earth

    ndsipa_pomu: They may well avoid terrestrial threats by having them in space,
    but then they become subject to different threats such as solar storms, high
    energy cosmic rays, space debris collisions etc.  I think the main reason to
    host them in space is to escape Earth jurisdictions, but even that is dubious as
    there will be people involved that reside on the Earth.

    pointlessone: While it’s true that there are no floods or earthquakes in space
    it’s not exactly a safe place to be. Radiation and cosmic rays become a much
    greater threat. Shielding provided by the atmosphere would have to be replaced.
    You also underestimate the cooling problem. The fact that space is cold doesn’t
    mean it’s easy to cool things off in space. On earth the main cooling strategy
    is to transfer heat through direct contact and move the hot stuff away. Be it
    air or water, as you mentioned. In space your only option is to radiate heat
    away. And that’s while half of you is under intense sunlight.  I think you also
    undersell the thread of warfare in space. Sure, a guy with Molotov can’t get you
    space data center but we’ve had satellite shot down. So maybe not every war is a
    threat but, say China or Russia (or other space-faring nation) could take care
    of a satellite if absolutely needed.  National seizures are also still a threat.
    If only being outside national borders was such a great defense we’d see some
    data centers in the sea by now.  So being in space is immune to some of the
    known problems but also comes with a whole lot of novel issues, not solved at
    scale yet. And so far I haven’t seen any sufficiently detailed proposed
    solutions to even consider the trade of known problems with readily available
    solutions for new issues with lots of unknowns.

        jtrn: I am not saying it's viable or not. I'm saying that the  statement the
        author put forward for why it's Absolutely not viable, is not valid.  That's why
        I said I actually don't think it's realistic in my post. He might be right, but
        some of his reasons are wrong.

    panda-giddiness: Essentially all of your concerns concerns can be mitigated by
    building somewhere else.  Worried about natural disasters? Build some place less
    prone to natural disasters.  Worried about the strain on local communities?
    Build some place more remote.  Worried about energy availability? Build near a
    nuclear power plant or hydroelectric power station.  Worried about hostile
    governments? Don't build data centers within the territories of hostile
    governments. (If you consider every country a hostile government, that is a you-
    problem.)  For the cost of building a data center in space, you could instead
    build a second (or third, or fourth, ...) data center somewhere else.

        jtrn: Omg. I dident say my reasons where good. I said that the claim that price
        vs ground based data center alone made space based compute a no God, was a bad
        argument. I obviously suck at framing my point

    jacquesm: One of the bigger threats to life on earth right now is called Elon
    Musk.

        jtrn: That's the stupidest thing I heard so far to day.

    turtlesdown11: > Data stored in space can exist outside of national borders,
    protecting it from seizure, censorship, or the legal jurisdiction of unstable
    governments.  You are aware physical persons exist on Earth and can be taken
    into custody? Additionally, space weapons exist, several governments could
    destroy any orbital satellite.  This whole pipe dream is nonsense.

    snowwrestler: Every artificial satellite falls around the Earth in a little
    bubble of terrestrial national law.  On the ground, legal notions of private
    property provide some legal protections against national government
    interference. But there is no private real property in space. 100% of the volume
    of space is subject to the direct jurisdiction of terrestrial national
    governments. Every artificial satellite persists only because they are permitted
    to do so by their national government.  Because of the speed and energy
    involved, in the U.S. all private space activity is a matter of national
    security. This means that there are far fewer legal protections, not more. The
    U.S. president could directly order SpaceX to do almost anything, and they would
    have to comply. Musk spends tremendous energy and money maintaining alignment
    with the governments he needs to satisfy to stay in business.

egorfine: Truth doesn't matter.  What matters is that investors and shareholders
love to hear about future space data centers.  Obligatory /s.

cess11: "Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost effective"  The
author forgot to add that this is only true from the perspective of their own
bias.  To someone else it might make a lot of sense, e.g. someone who expects
militant resistance to the "data centers" from the general public or some other
actor that is highly unlikely to achieve space capabilities.

pftburger: Reasonably sure this has less to do with putting data centres in
space and more to do with getting them less auditable (see the other news about
X getting raided about Grok)

trashb: As others point out this is a bad idea.  Asside from the other excellent
comments on power consumption, cooling and radiation. One point I didn't see
being made in the comments much is maintenance costs.  Now I don't find myself
in the facility of a data center often in daily life, however I do know that
medium to big data centers require 24/7 hardware replacement. I believe this is
what those 5 guys with the bikes and scooters are doing in every data center.
That would be very difficult, near impossible in space (with the current space
fairing infrastructure).

    laverya: Do those people actually _repair_ hardware, or do they swap bad
    hardware for good chips?  Can SpaceX not just say "OK, GPU #7 on satellite
    #15872 is broken, don't use it" and just accept that they're now overbuilt on
    power/cooling for that sat?

        trashb: From what I understand it is in part swapping it, in part upgrading it.
        Some of it is preventative some of it is reactive. They could overbuild the
        hardware and slowly disable capacity I think that will not really work. Data
        centers are static in infrastructure but not in the systems running within them.
        Actually they are constantly changing to meet the needs.  Overbuilding also
        comes with a cost when talking about space, it is still very costly to get stuff
        up there and there is limited bandwidth downstream, you want to balance those
        two. So if you're overbuilding it costs a lot to get up there, if you disable
        what's up there you don't fully utilize the bandwidth.  For example AI data
        centers now use very different hardware compared to 5 or 10 years ago that
        upgrade path is just a lot harder when your data center is in space.

lisp2240: The French government issued a child porn warrant for the CEO and it
isn't even a topic for discussion. That's what doesn't make sense to me. It's
silly to talk about solar panel prices like reality matters at all to his cult
of followers. It doesn't have to make sense. The less sense the better.

    mytailorisrich: It's not a warrant, it is a summon for interview. That's
    actually very different: the way you phrased it suggests that there is a warrant
    for his arrest (mandat d'arrêt)...

sam_goody: I get it. This is a scam. The discussion is not about what you think
it is. (EDIT: Or not, I don't care.)  BUT the fact that we are even arguing
about whether or not we should be putting data centers into space is so
incredibly absurd to someone who watched the Challenger explode and assumed that
space wouldn't be ventured into again in my lifetime.  People don't realize how
much the priors have changed. Take a minute to appreciate that. We are living in
a world where people are debating if it makes sense to spend a bazillion dollars
to put a hard disk into orbit.  I wonder if the Klingons are good at cyber
warfare.

    foobiekr: The problem is that software people are clueless.

nemo136: No, but protecting x/xAI from bankruptcy by linking it to the most
promising company in Musk's portfolio does. You just need a justification.  This
is while they try to find a solution to earn money with it.

alkonaut: The worst thing about this isn't that it makes no sense. It's that it
doesn't even _try_ to make sense.  These companies wanted to merge for financial
reasons and the invented reason is nonsensical. We shouldn't even give the
nonsensical reason the benefit of trying to make sense of it.

blauditore: The Kessler syndrome is mentioned, satellites colliding, causing a
cascade of follow-up collisions. This gets brought up a lot, but people have a
poor intuition on how large the orbit space is. Think of it this way: It's
obviously larger that Earth's surface, and placing, say, a million objects on
Earth still leaves a lot of space between them (there are thousands as many
humans). Yes, satellites move in certain orbits, not in random places, but space
is large, and humans are bad with imagining large numbers and things. The
illustrations with fat dots on tiny earth images are misleading too IMO.  Apart
of that, I do agree that space data centers are probably just a marketing stunt
at this point, although some things could obviously be done to increase their
chances, like more lightweight designs on GPUs, something that was never a big
topic before.

    padjo: The other way people get confused about Kessler syndrome is that they
    imagine it's like the movie Gravity where it happens suddenly rather than a slow
    process that plays out over years/decades.

pointlessone: Whatever it is it’s not driven by sense or even feasibility of
data centers in space.  To me it looks like the next Musk’s grift. Remember
Mars? Have you heard about it recently? He threw it to the Internet and everyone
got excited for a minute. Then nerds did quick math and it didn’t make any
sense. And so everyone forgot about Mars. This is the same. Hype everyone up for
a week or two to inflate stock before the merger/purchase/IPO/whatever. That is
all.

    hamburgererror: Exactly, Musk is just playing pump and dump with industrial
    projects.

InsideTehMatrix: AST Spacemobile is successfully deploying cell towers in space;
to compete with Elons Starlink. Not to mention ASTS is collaborating with
American Tower, Google, ATT, Verizon, Nokia, and other big dogs for this
venture. Now a DC is magnitudes different then a cell tower/satellite but hey ..
if the RoI is there, it can be done

OsamaJaber: Keep talking like that and people will colonize space

lambdaone: The thing I find most notable is the lack of any concrete information
on how these things are to be cooled, other than quotes like "space cooling is
free".  If you want to radiate away the heat, you are either limited by the
Stefan-Boltzmann equation which requires extraordinarily large radiators at any
reasonable operating temperature, or have to develop a "super-Planckian"
radiator technology, something which while it may be theoretically possible
doesn't seem to actually exist yet as a practical technology.  The only other
plausible technology I can think of would be to use evaporative or sublimation-
based cooling, but that would consume vast quantities of mass in the process,
every bit of which would have to be delivered to space first.  Has anyone seen
any published work that suggests it is actually anywhere near economically
feasible to dissipate megawatts of power in space, using either these or any
other technology?

elvircrn: Surprised nobody here linked https://andrewmccalip.com/space-
datacenters.

Snoozus: This only makes sense if it somehow helps to evade some kind of
regulation. I'm not quite sure which though.

SilverBirch: I'm sorry I really don't understand this. I have a computer. I put
it in a warehouse. You have a computer, you shoot it into space. What problem
have you solved?  Is this all an effort to utilize more efficient solar panels?
Are solar panels really the limiting factor for data centres?

    AlexandrB: I think some people like this because it pushes libertarian "no need
    for environmental or regulatory review" buttons. There's a kernel of a valid
    argument there, but it seems overstated given that companies seem to have little
    trouble getting approval for big datacenter buildouts here on earth.  There's
    also the coolness factor, I guess.  But why does no one talk about launching
    RackSpace servers into space? I think the whole thing is tied to AI because of
    the hype, not because sending servers into space has any kind of material
    advantages.

        iamleppert: Not to mention the fact that you trade one source of pollution for
        another. You think giant rockets to lift tons of equipment into space is good
        for the environment?

deafpolygon: It’s less about putting compute in space as occupying that space
before anyone else does. For any reason: spying, space warfare, network and
communication.  First mover advantage, and all.

    NathanKP: Bingo. I elaborated on this idea more in my comment:
    https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46884246  People are acting like a space
    data centre would be running a traditional workload. No, it's probably running a
    military one, some sort of AI powered modern version of Dead Hand
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand). Autonomous warfare could get real
    dark, real fast.

Ekaros: Thinking of power infra. Even solar. Doesn't that last 20 or 30 years at
least? With some maintenance, but before full overhaul. So in space you would
probably decommission it at same time right? Wouldn't that be additional cost?

NathanKP: My dark theory is that the goal is to run an AI overlord in space such
that it is difficult to counter it from Earth.  If you assume that these people
aren't completely stupid, then there is some reason why they want this workload
running at great physical distance from all the people down on Earth. It's
probably not to protect people on Earth. After all they'll happily deorbit
satellites and other junk from orbit and let it rain down on us. And they will
happily destroy the environment with all those rocket launches too. Therefore it
must be to protect the workload from us.  What is a workload that is something
that people would probably want to destroy, and which would also provide enough
value to offset the expense to launch and run in space? The only thing that
might make sense is a military AI platform. Think something that observes Earth,
launches missiles, and controls terrestrial drone armies remotely, with
relatively low latency.  It gets built and launched thanks to endless military
budget, and once it is up there, running such an AI from space means that
effectively the only people who can take it out are nation state level foes who
can launch rockets into low earth orbit. And this thing is a satellite, probably
part of a network that is watching the Earth all the time. Start building
something that looks like a rocket launch site, and the AI will see, then you
get hit by a missile or taken out by a drone first before you get a chance to
attack the platform.  It sounds like sci-fi, but in the future, if we let it
happen, there could absolutely be nearly invulnerable autonomous AI platforms in
space overseeing everything, and making decisions, and issuing commands. Of
course there could still be a massive solar flare event, or a Kessler syndrome
event that releases us all from AI enforced servitude. Anyway, it's a not so fun
thought experiment, and let's hope this stays sci-fi, so we can just enjoy a fun
Hollywood film about this rather than experiencing it firsthand.

running101: This is when you know we reached peak AI. Data centers in space
talk.

    ravenstine: Almost.  We will see peek once a pyramid scheme proposing that
    everyone can profit off AI emerges.

fsloth: Of course it makes sense. It's a cool story to pump up the valuation in
the AI datacenter boom. This meme will keep on delivering until (if) the AI
bubble bursts.

mxfh: The whole premise misses the point, that earth is somehow in the very same
space too.  Adding a global UHVDC grid to even out dips in local PV performance
due to cloud cover and the diurnal cycle on spaceship earth seems to be
magnitudes cheaper and scaleable than this loony pitch.  The only thing making
this hard is requiring supranational collaboration.

jhoechtl: Space - no. Moon - yes  Space is cold but has little mass. Either heat
can radiated or transfered. To transfer heat, mass which easily absorbs heat is
required. The moon might be suitable for that.

aeon_ai: Elon announced this so he could troll the comments on HN and get all of
this incredibly valuable armchair expertise in solving his problems.

dhab: By combining ai with space, in addition to any other plays that he might
be playing around legal or financial areas, he's positioning (marketing) spaceX
for the bandwagon that everyone else might jump into to deploy a space
datacentre. He's providing the medium (spacex rockets) to realise this
potentially unfeasible idea. He makes additional money that way - to then create
a new type of money-making fuel after that. HN audience might be calculative -
but the rest of the population is far less so.  This might also be a new vehicle
to mask any space warfare technology deployments.

rando77: You might want some compute in space that you know is very hard to
physically interfere with.  But general purpose compute no

andix: It's a scam for investors.  The self-driving car worked too well. Tesla
is promising that for over a decade now, and still can't deliver. They came much
closer to the goal, but are still very far away from it. Shareholders don't seem
to care.

danieljanes: ViT (Vision Transformer) fine-tuned on a Starcloud satellite in
space (using the Flower framework) -- to the best of our knowledge, this is a
world first: https://flower.ai/blog/2026-02-02-flower-labs-and-starcloud-...

chias: Data centers in space make perfect sense, in exactly the same way as a
jetpack made perfect sense. It is an excellent vehicle to ride out some juicy
government contracts for as long as you can keep the grift going.
https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/17/fake-it-until-you-dont-ma...

Nevermark: Heat energy shedding is often talked about as an Achilles Heal of
orbital computation.  But heat radiation rates are proportional to temperature
to the 4th power!!!!  That is a magical law. The quality of heat pumps used to
concentrate heat, will drive the economics and structure of heat dissipation.
Seldom do we get constraints that favorable to work with.

JKCalhoun: Feels like this is about as unserious as flamethrowers, the Boring
Company, and Hyperloop.  We're living in the Age of Distraction… amusing
ourselves to death (as usual).

wendgeabos: Consider:   If you genuinely believe that the only important goal is
to make life multiplanetary,  (and note I'm not defending this position here,
just asserting it as an explanation of behavior)  then anything that drives
money towards your work on that goal is worth pursuing particularly if you think
time is short.

inglor_cz: This being a forum full of engineers, it is not surprising that
everyone concentrates on the technical challenges thereof. But that may be a
distraction.  I suspect that Musk wants to build space data centers in order to
mitigate political and societal problems, which may yet prove more intractable
than cooling in space.  The current expansion of terrestrial data centers has
already caused a huge backlash. Their adversaries may well try to regulate them
out of existence, at least locally. If an important jurisdiction like California
or Germany subjects building of new data centers to regulations similar to
building, say, a new nuclear power station, they will achieve a de-facto stop on
further development there even without banning them outright.  Space, while not
entirely lawless, is much harder to regulate this way. Local authorities have no
power over it, nor do governments of nations without space capabilities. Big
authorities of big nations (the FAA etc.) do, but they will likely be more
friendly to already established launch businesses like SpaceX, not least because
of the geopolitical dimensions of having a vibrant space sector.  From Musk's
POV, this may be worth the additional cost and technical troubles.

hk1337: I don’t know, it probably would have been useful if Cyberdyne Systems
had developed its AI in space?

ineedasername: It makes sense if you want low-latency compute accessible to
other things in space making use of it: Pharmaceutical research, manufacturing.
These are large, non speculative areas of likely growth in the space industry.
Manufacturing especially will require lots of inference compute with the AI
systems currently under development for industrial robotics.  If you're looking
at this and saying "Lol, no, we don't need data centers in space just to power
more GPT sycophancy and some health insurance company's RAG workflows." Then
you're right, so just move on from that usage and consider the things we'd like
to do in space, and especially the things we're already doing but want to do
more of.  I know, my gut was telling me this is ridiculous, premature at best
even through the lens of expanding space industry. But then with respect to the
need for data centers-- had I even thought about it a year ago, my gut would
have laughed if someone had said "Buy Wester Digital, HDD's are a growth stock".

varispeed: It makes sense if you want to avoid tax. You can put artificial costs
and deduct them. Nobody is going to go to space and check.

groundzeros2015: When an invention has not been made before it’s usually because
people are lacking an insight that the inventors have.  You can’t read a 300
word article in 1930 and know that a formula 1 engine could not be built.

furyg3: This whole thing is Musk just trying to keep the hype train going.  Musk
has learned one neat trick from all of his (quite admirable) success with Tesla
and SpaceX: hype is more profitable than actually doing stuff that generates
value now.  Tesla's valuation has been nuts for a while.  The music was going to
stop playing at some point, so something something robotaxis, something
something androids, something something AI.  Keep the investors duped while you
can move money around and leverage it to stay relevant.  Cars are out, social
media as well (especially X), but Space is still in, and even more so AI.  So
let's move the cost center with world domination potential (AI) over to the one
company that's making money and has a still has a cash-out potential via an IPO.
I'm just so tired of it all.  I actually think 'boutique' businesses (companies
that generate real value to real users and are profitable now) are the only
thing that can save our economy medium-term, but investors and the government
are having none of it.  And the result is that these bait-and-switch scams will
continue.

jongjong: Clearly the desire to have data centers in space is so that AI can
control humans remotely without having to worry about backlash and potential
dismantling.  Besides this, it's concerning how much stuff we're sending to
space. One day we'll have to start worrying about satellite parts falling on us.

BiteCode_dev: Can't wait for competitors destroying the other guys installation
because just like international waters, there is no police or border there.

cbeach: I'm glad I read HN.  My take-away is - SpaceX is still an extremely good
stock to hold. However, the stupid money will buy the stock at IPO on the
promise of space datacentres.  When SpaceX inevitably u-turns on this plan and
the stock plummets temporarily, THAT will be a good time to buy in.

indycliff: It sounds cool and gets investors.

rushingcreek: One major point I haven’t seen mentioned is maintenance.  Nvidia
GPUs, particularly H100s, have a failure rate orders of magnitudes higher than
traditional CPU-only hardware. I myself have accidentally melted an H100 during
a large-scale training run.  While it’s trivial to replace a broken GPU in the
ground, it seems to be infeasible in space during the life of the satellite.
Getting a human or robot “fixer” spacecraft to it would likely cost more than
the $30K GPU itself.

t312227: hello,  as always: imho. (!)  we already had this topic before, an
example for another good article regarding physical arguments against this idea
would be:  "Datacenters in space are a terrible, horrible, no good idea" ~ late
2025  * https://taranis.ie/datacenters-in-space-are-a-terrible-horri...  TL;DR:
It's not going to work.  idk ... maybe elon has something else in mind with this
merger!?  cheers,  a..z

kgwxd: This sound like a Musk "idea". click. Of course.

qoez: > Training and serving frontier AI at scale takes hundreds of thousands of
GPUs. xAI’s Colossus cluster reportedly has 200,000 GPUs. OpenAI has plans for
millions of them. Competing in this market would require launching hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of satellites into space  No? You'd only need one
with lots of gpus on the ship at the same time

tgtweak: The crux of it is that radiative cooling in space is dependent on
exposed surface, not total surface area like a radiator or heatsink on earth -
this means if you just put an existing finned heatsink in space it would radiate
most of it's heat back to itself - the only net cooling you'd have is the amount
that can radiate outwards without hitting itself.  For a benchmark - the IIS
uses about 4500sqft (420 sqm) of radiators just to keep it's onboard equipment
(~70KW) cooled.  That's ~150-200 W/sqm.  That means, per GPU, you'd need about
2.5-3.0 sqm of passive radiators.  For a 1MW satellite (~8 datacenter racks of
GB200/NVL72) you'd need basically half a football field of bleeding-edge solar
panels (that also need to radiate their heat on the reverse side) and a similar
sized cooling array of heat radiators for the electronics.  This is on the scale
of 40-50 tons - about 10% of the IIS.  This should fit on falcon heavy or
starship - assuming the solar array and radiators can fold up to fit inside.
You could, purely based on weight, launch 2 of these per starship launch.  If
you consider the Opex savings (electricity, rent, facilities maintenance) and
putting 2 of these on a single starship launch, I still think the ROI would be
too long.  You're saving about ~$1M per year in Opex but it's costing you $25M
to launch it into space and likely an extra ~$50M in satellite equipment (based
on starlink satellite costs) on top of the compute.  Will those GPUs still be
useful in 10 years? Probably not.  I don't think the math is there that
justifies the free electricity - even at gigawatt scale (thousands of satellites
mass-produced) and at a dramatically lower cost per satellite and per launch.
Getting costs down on this would involve tightly integrating the compute and the
satellite hardware which would make upgrading the compute independently from the
cooling/power infrastructure in the future a significant challenge.

    gwbas1c: Makes me wonder:  Back in the early 1990s I read some children's
    futurist book that suggested that we might send solar panels to space that would
    then beam energy via microwaves to the surface. The book was more fantasy than
    science, so I took it with a huge grain of salt and appreciated it for its
    entertainment value.  But do you think schemes that try to direct solar energy
    to the surface are more practical then running datacenters in space?

        tgtweak: I don't think there is calculus that makes the cost of getting it to
        space worth putting it there - Elon of all people knows this - if you scale up
        the ground-based solar and add battery storage, the costs are still far lower
        than trying to put that in space to gain more hours of usable sun and higher
        intensity sun... it's just not cost effective until panels are paper thin, weigh
        nothing and the cost of launches and thus per-ton to orbit gets an order of
        magnitude cheaper.

        foobiekr: Space based power arrays with microwave transmission to massive ground
        fields has been discussed for nearly sixty years. It doesn't make economic
        sense, at all.  https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/space-based-so...
        I would love it to be a thing, but it is not a thing.

    foobiekr: The lifetime of a GPU in practice is around 3 years. There is no way
    this plan is going to work. Musk knows that, he's just counting on stupid people
    to buy into the SpaceX IPO on hype.

est: Data centers in space have one advantage: FBIs can't physically raid them.

TGower: I wonder if the author was making similar arguments against solar power
20 years ago. The case for both isn't one of immediate ecenomic advantage,
though that may come with sufficient development like solar has had. If you take
it as a given that compute demand continues scaling, at some point we will need
to shift power generation off Earth, and it's a lot easier to move computed data
streams instead of terrawatts of power.

1970-01-01: Until someone actually launches a prototype, this is not happening.
The economy of just doing everything on the ground is underestimated. And the
technology simply is still not ready. LEO sats randomly falling down is a daily
occurrence. I would love to see the Excel spreadsheet these investors are
drooling over. It probably has less than 6 tabs.

    originalvichy: This is the same guy that had his followers preach about how cars
    in tunnels for public transit is better than… trains in tunnels… Do not expect
    logical arguments when dealing with this guy and his followers.

wkoszek: Starship payload: 100,000 kg (100 tons). Looks like they talked about
150 tons and even 250 tons. My understanding is that they can be adding more
engines to get more thrust.  https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2022/02/spacex-
reusable-rocket... -- looks like target price for Starship launch would be
$3--$5m according to the author.  Wouldn't the /kg price to SpaceX be:
3000000/100000 = $30/kg -- 5000000/100000 = $50/kg?  If they recover everything
and produce fuel at scale, wouldn't it drop the cost even more.  What many
people quote here are commercial rates, I think. SpaceX won't pay those prices.
Can someone check my math

zouhair: Data centers on earth don't make sense either.

alcomatt: heat dissipation is one thing - another is the recycling - anything he
shoots into the orbit will essentially be disposable, single use DCs. Once they
fail, it will be just a dangerous junk waiting to be deorbited. And all the
precious materials which normally get recycled will be lost....

krick: Honestly, it is funny that people even seriously discuss this. I mean,
now. It is such a blatant bullshit that you'd expect this time people would say
"okay, now Musk went too far, nobody would buy into this". Yeah, I wish.

formvoltron: With all that great tech to land and reuse rockets, they still need
to be propelled into space using... kerosene.  That's right.  1 million
satellites launched into orbit using kerosene.  Does not feel like a vibe.

jstummbillig: Cool! If there are people working on something, despite others
saying "it makes no sense" I assume it's a hard and interesting enough problem.

ck2: I mean everything he does is so honest, rational and well thought out in
detail, right?  How's that full-self driving promised for decades working out?
How's the destruction of USAID working out (oh you wouldn't know a million dead
now)  We already have a data-center in space, sort-of, here's how many radiation
panels it has to deploy for just the heat produced from the small number of low-
power computers  * https://i.sstatic.net/cpIBo.jpg  (ISS, all those white panels
are thermal heat radiators)

gadders: This blog post has some sliders you can tweak to see if you can make
the numbers make sense: https://andrewmccalip.com/space-datacenters  "So here's
what I did. I built a simple model that reduces the debate to one parameter:
cost per watt of usable power for compute. The infographic below lets you change
the assumptions directly. If you disagree with the inputs, great. Move the
sliders. But at least we'll be arguing over numbers that map to reality.  The
model is deliberately boring. No secret sauce. Just publicly available numbers
and first-principles physics: solar flux, cell efficiency, radiator performance,
launch cost, hardware mass, and a terrestrial benchmark that represents the real
alternative: a tilt-wall datacenter sitting on top of cheap power. "  "Here's
the headline result: it's not obviously stupid, and it's not a sure thing. It's
actually more reasonable than my intuition thought! If you run the numbers
honestly, the physics doesn't immediately kill it, but the economics are savage.
It only gets within striking distance under aggressive assumptions, and the list
of organizations positioned to even try that is basically one."

garettmd: prompt: what's the term for financial moves where you keep finding new
investors to pay off the previous ones  GPT-4o mini: The term for financial
moves where new investors are continually recruited to pay off previous ones is
often referred to as a "Ponzi scheme." Another similar term is "pyramid scheme,"
where returns are paid to earlier investors from the contributions of newer
investors, but with a structure that typically requires participants to recruit
others to earn returns. Both schemes are unsustainable and illegal.

maxdo: I have my personal reasons to hate Elon. But the article is full of fluff
and lacks imagination, typical of the "the world is static and will never
change" mindset.  What they are trying to do is an a very ambitious engineering
challenge in several highly integrated domains, from spaceships to robotics,
gpu, server design , ai.  Typical stakes are high margins are high.  Project
also pushes boundaries of what human can do the same way starlink did. 20 years
ago starlink scale was also an "impossible" thing. Is it possible now to push
one gpu and serve it from space? Yes, can you do it at scale? Big question.
Obstacles :  Price per kg to orbit. They aim to go from $150 to $10 per kg. Can
they deliver? Big question, but having something that demands so many starship,
like GPU heavy tasks, will help them achieve this goal. Benefits? No rent, no
cooling issues, cheap sun-powered electricity 24 hours a day, unlike anywhere
else on Earth.  Jurisdiction. Servers can't be shut down or taken away by
police, etc.  Cooling. Yes, it's a vacuum, but with $10 per kg, you can deliver
pipes and coolant, and since you don't have space constraints, you can build
these pipes with a robot, making that datacenter extremely cheap.  3. Labor. If
a robot can do primitive tasks combined with design that is fully remote, you
labor costs goes almost to 0.  the output: with $10 per pg, delivering solar
panels, coolant + robot for some urgent fixes. Robots even with current
technology can swap a harddrive for example, especially if hardware is built to
be mantained by robots not human.  You don't need large construction, you invest
into design, that once assembled , cost you maybe comparable amount of hardware
to deliver.  After that it runs for free!  The economy if this obviously beating
anything exised on earth.

    infinitewars: Elon is that you?

    AlexandrB: > Jurisdiction. Servers can't be shut down or taken away by police,
    etc.  Total pipe dream. They can't take away your servers, but they can imprison
    you until you provide access. And SpaceX would still fall under the laws of
    whichever country it's based in. If lawful access is really a problem, laws will
    be written to make it SpaceX's problem. Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/538/

        maxdo: yes... and no. Right now you need a server lets say in france. You are
        fully in their jurisdiction, for latency etc.  What if your server fly over
        france , but not in France, hence: you don't need to build servers in france,
        unlike before, you don't need to deal with local government on so many issues,
        water, electricity etc to be local in france.  And , taxes : crypto payments +
        compute , and same transaction in france doesn't have to be taxed anymore :)
        Yes, you have to pay taxes to US government, but not to france.

            foobiekr: And if France decides to jam you until you play nice?

                maxdo: it's extreemly hard to jam starlink, ask russians at war. also that gpu
                run results can be connected somewhere in england, and requested using ipv6 e.g.
                you need to start moderating internet heavily etc.

septune: You’re missing one important point: radiated power scales with the
fourth power of temperature. Could it be that xAI has a chip capable of
operating at very high temperatures?

sp4cec0wb0y: Ground-based data centers will always be cheaper. There is no
advantage in space that makes it worth spending more.

stronglikedan: It's fun to debate this and all, but the reality is that
datacenters in space are going to happen, and soon - maybe even this year. If
we've come this far, then there's already a viable plan that we just don't know
about yet.

pranavm27: I had this idea in the beginning of last year and since I wanted to
somehow get into space infra started doing some calculations - the area of
arrays required kinda made me scrap the whole thing. But kinda curious since
this is back as a mainstream topic.

1vuio0pswjnm7: "So if this is clearly nonsense, why are serious companies and
investors piling into it?"  What does "serious" mean

hermitShell: After looking for a top level comment pointing to why instead of
how, I logged in just for this as I could not find one. Extremely bullish on
this move, let me try to explain.  As most engineers realize right away, it is
not going to be profitable to operate a regular datacenter in space, per the
article (and I agree), so something else is going on here. Almost all the
discussion is about feasibility, which is not by itself going to explain the
situation.  It is clearly somewhat feasible to build Starlink level
infrastructure and operate it profitably. I would posit that the narrative is a
funding vehicle for a more conservative, incremental objective.  The very fact
that the infrastructure is in space places the datacenter on the legal and
geopolitical high ground. It's hard to raid servers if they are in orbit. It's
hard to disable, audit, or arm-wrestle into submission. It doesn't have to have
the scale we've come to expect in 2026 to be useful. And it's for inference, not
training, of course. Useful levels of inference is computationally cheap. There
are implications with the financial system as well.  In combination with PLTR
technology, what I see is another intelligent and strategic move by Musk to
enable and be part of hegemony. He is a central player not making decisions in
isolation. They are playing a game with different rules, and therefore different
unit economics.

rishabhjain1198: > Data centers in space only make sense if they are cost
effective relative to normal data centers.  This statement is actually
completely false. The bottleneck is not cost of building data centers, but the
energy accessible on the planet. How much we're willing to pay for increasing
that is currently very unclear, but it's far more than the current cost of
building a terrestrial data center.  As Jensen Huang famously touted their
performance per watt, saying "Our customers won't buy our competitor's chips
even if they were free."

    danans: > This statement is actually completely false. The bottleneck is not
    cost of building data centers, but the energy accessible on the planet.  How
    much of energy will it take to launch the same amount of compute, connectivity,
    and PV to power it  into space?

        rishabhjain1198: Good question.

NedCode: But data centers in the sea...

ZebusJesus: We really need to stop letting Musk and others just put what ever
they want in space we are getting close to the Kessler limit and that could be
very very bad if it happens. They have some ideas but this is already and issue,
China had an issue after a launch were debris hit the capsule breaking it
forcing them to send a second capsule.

xorcist: It's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to be cool and signal
that demand for the stock will not go down.

devin: As long as we're pointing out things that don't make sense: A long time
ago in the United States we decided to run electricity _everywhere_, even
farmhouses in the middle of nowhere. The solution to broadband in the United
States is somehow, inexplicably "Let's use satellites" rather than increase
tower coverage or run hard lines. It is a _terrible_ solution to this problem
based on the cost alone.

    indoordin0saur: I've used Starlink and it's fantastic in rural areas. Why dig
    thousands of miles of holes for physical wires when the problem is already
    solved?

        devin: Think. You don't even need to dig. We have myriad wireless internet
        solutions. We did not need to send satellites into space to fix this problem in
        a far more cost effective way.

            midtake: Terrestrial wireless internet solutions are stupid. With a satellite
            you can be anywhere with line of sight to the southern sky and receive signal.
            With some shitty tower you're still constrained to your location just as you
            would be with wired, except that instead of a fast, low latency cable you have a
            noisy, outage prone wireless tower.

                devin: This is not a problem that needed to be solved by satellites. It is a
                failure of US politics that rural areas don't have broadband. We didn't need
                some private company to put satellites into low earth orbit for someone to watch
                a youtube video from their house reliably. The ongoing costs and complexities of
                running a global satellite network vs running a cable is insane.

Eggpants: Back when I worked at AWS, I wrote a one page “press release” about
this concept where the value add was the weight/power reduction of customer sats
that could offload on board processing to the “Cloud above the Clouds”.  There
is a bottleneck with the down/uplink ground stations to do the on the ground
processing.  The biggest problem folks had was even with equipment with 99.9%
reliability something breaks every day due the huge raw number of devices
involved. And most network equipment is not any where close to being radiation
hardened.  I had some fun with it with Bezo’s fist bumping folks because SpaceX
was cleaning BlueOrigin clock.  I talked to one of their lawyers and didn’t hear
anything afterwards. I left AWS and a couple of years later Amazon announced AWS
ground station. I wonder how much my paper contributed to green lighting that
project.

cryptonector: Data centers in space make no sense because cooling things in
space is insanely hard!  Yeah, space is cold, but also you don't have access to
large thermal masses with which to exchange heat, so the fact that space is cold
does not help much.  In space the only option for cooling is large radiators.
If you had a data center in space you'd need enormous radiators -- much larger
than the data center itself.  (On Earth we can exchange heat with the
environment, and the environment includes convection and the water cycle and
ultimately can expel excess heat via high altitude condensation of water vapor
where most of the heat released escapes to space.  As well clouds can both block
insolation as well as keep heat below trapped, but altogether between high
altitude condensation and blocking insolation this is the mechanism by which
Earth keeps its temperature as a random walk around the average that we enjoy.)

fuzzfactor: It's not supposed to make sense when you're screening for supporters
who will believe anything you say.

UltraSane: After the hyperloop fiasco I don't understand why anyone gives Musk
any credibility at all

tpurves: Closest thing to a usecase I can think of are all military in nature.
There's an argument that AI in space only begins to make any sense if the data
source you are processing is also originating in space, and you need (for
reasons) to run models on it in space before downlinking the results.  Maybe
there's a very latency sensitive need to send realtime targeting information to
a tomahawk missile in flight? But it's also too bandwidth, compute or cost
intensive to send a firehose of raw spy-satellite data to a disposable one-way
attack munition?  The data centers in space are actually for the spy satellites
to use. That's all I got for practical applications.

zippyman55: I loved when we would have an HPC server crash and we would analyze
the issue and the vendor would respond, "probably a neutrino strike".  I can't
imagine this being more complex, given all the constraints of being in an orbit.
The hardware depreciation, and the need to eliminate charge buildup and excess
heat.  Placing servers in the Arctic seems a better solution, at least the
cooling issue is resolved.

amelius: How do you protect a datacenter in space from evil nation states that
have an appetite for your GPU cards?

loourr: I think the thing I often see missed in these discussions is the cost
and time burden imposed by regulation. It's nearly impossible to build power
plants in the US today. Launching satellites while hard, solves this problem.
Even if it's more expensive, Spacex will be able to deploy hardware when no one
else can because all the gas turbines and existing power plants have been
exhausted and the lead time to build new ones is 5+ years out because of the
bureaucratic overhead.

    vel0city: > It's nearly impossible to build power plants in the US today  If
    you're just building solar panels and using batteries you don't need grid
    approval to build it and connect it to your own datacenter. The same is true if
    you're wanting to just use natural gas to a large extent, although you'll have
    more regulations regarding environmental emissions. But you'll get that when
    you're trying to get a million space launches approved as well.

mchusma: The bull case IMO is that you can just produce very standardized ai
satellites, load them into Starship, blast them off and have them work. And that
the cost of that versus permitting etc will be less than trying to do it on
land. I kind of believe it could get there. We could build nuclear reactors next
to giant facilities but...we can't really seem to do it in the US? China seems
to be able to do it.  PS. I think the authors argument that millions of
satellites might run into each other is silly. There are like 1.5 B cars.

Rover222: The top comment: "Musk is up to something here."  It never fails here.
Ya'll are soooo determined to assume ulterior motivations. He has always been
direct about his motivations, whether it's about politics or business decisions.
To suspect his whole plan for datacenters in space is a ruse or something to
drive up some stock price (or whatever), is... just ridiculous. You really think
they person who leads SpaceX (more satellites than the rest of the world
combined) and Xai (with a competitive frontier model in 2 years starting from
scratch), and Tesla (more inference compute than any company on Earth) really
knows less than you about the math and physics of this idea??  His immediate
focus for Starship has shifted from Mars colonisation to exponential expansion
of intelligence, as he thinks it's the best path to extend consciousness.
Ridiculous or not, he believes that, and that's the motivation.

cowthulhu: What is the real-world advantage of putting datacenters in space?

niemandhier: Data Centers in space make no sense due to radiation.  You cannot
do two things at the same time:  1. Make electronics small.   2. Make
electronics radiation resistant.  It’s a numbers game. The denser things are
packed, the higher the probability that a random high energy particle or ray
will damage something.  20 years ago NASA was buying old chips, because those
were less susceptible, modern “radiation hardened by design” chips are better
than those, but still slower than those for planetary use.

virtualhat: The author seems to have confused a few things.  * They assume 1
satalite = 1 GPU. This is quite funny, actually. A single H200 floating in space
with a solar panel and an antenna. In reality, a satellite would pack as many
chips as the heat/power allows. A Starlink-sized satellite should be able to
hold 40 or so chips. There's no reason why a larger satellitte couldn't hold,
say, 1024. * They mention training, but sampling is what makes sense here.
Training is a different beast, and requires high reliability, high bandwidth,
low latency, and a lot of IO. Space would not be ideal for this. I'd expect
training to remain terrestrial and just do sampling in space. (FWIW, sampling
will be most of the compute allocation). * Also, no one upgrades GPUs in
datacenters, they just add new nodes and leave the old ones there. Google still
has their P100 nodes running. Not being able to fix them, though, is a
significant concern.

    ajyoon: Fair - my "millions" note is wrt SpaceX filing with the FCC to launch 1
    million satellites, and the Google viability study deals with large
    constellations rather than monolithic stations. Public communications from
    companies purporting to go into orbital data centers have made every appearance
    that they think virtually all compute can go to space.

2001zhaozhao: I was gonna say it is good for low-ping game servers, but then I
remembered that the data center would literally be orbiting around the planet
and ping would fluctuate by tens of milliseconds every few minutes.
