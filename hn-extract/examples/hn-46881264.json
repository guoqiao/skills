You&#x27;ve lost simple querying and digging through codebase. Gosh, lets even say you lost a bit of git command knowledge. You catch my drift here? I am completely for using AI as a tool to do a lot of the boilerplate work with the right directions. Though remembering some changes in codebase before and letting LLMs do the work, is not the same to me as fully owning up to your system as you know, you actually know.\nOld man shouting at screen so, to each their own of course!

I give this hunch to the AI which goes search in the codebase in the areas I suggested the problem could be and that&#x27;s when it find the issue and provide a fix\n    3. I think the problem could be spread given there is a method that removes the query filter, it could have been used in multiple places, so I ask AI to find other usages of it (thinking, this is my definition of &quot;steering&quot; in this context)\n    4. AI reports 3 more occurrences and suggests that 2 have the same bug, but one is ok\n    5. I go in, review the code and understand it and I agree, it doesn&#x27;t have the bug (thinking)\n    6. AI provide the fix for all the right spots, but I said &quot;wait, something is fishy here, there is a commit that explicitly say it was added to remove the filter, why is that?&quot; (thinking), so I ask AI to figure out why the commit says that\n    7. AI proceeds to run a bunch of git-history related commands, finds some commit and then does some correlation to find another commit. This other commit introduced the change at the same time to defend from a bug in a different place\n   8. I understand what&#x27;s going on now, I&#x27;m happy with the fix, the history suggests I am not breaking stuff.

It is this process, and your intimacy with the medium and the materials you’re shaping, that teaches you about what you’re making – its qualities, tolerances, and limits – even as you make it. You know the least about what you’re making the moment before you actually start making it. That’s when you think you know what you want to make. The process, which is an iterative one, is what leads you towards understanding what you actually want to make, whether you were aware of it or not at the beginning. Design is not merely about solving problems; it’s about discovering what the right problem to solve is and then solving it. Too often we fail not because we didn’t solve a problem well but because we solved the wrong problem.<p>When you skip the process of creation you trade the thing you could have learned to make for the simulacrum of the thing you thought you wanted to make. Being handed a baked and glazed artefact that approximates what you thought you wanted to make removes the very human element of discovery and learning that’s at the heart of any authentic practice of creation. Where you know everything about the thing you shaped into being from when it was just a lump of clay, you know nothing about the image of the thing you received for your penny from the vending machine.&quot;",

Surely you&#x27;ve thought about other avenues here as well.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a domain where the 70% AI solution is a total failure, that&#x27;s the field. You can&#x27;t rely on vibe coding because the underlying math, like Learning With Errors (LWE) or supersingular isogeny graphs, is conceptually dense and hasn&#x27;t been commoditized into AI training data yet. It requires that same &#x27;several-day-soak&#x27; thinking you loved in physics, specifically because we&#x27;re trying to build systems that remain secure even against an adversary with a quantum computer. It’s one of the few areas left where the Thinker isn&#x27;t just a luxury, but a hard requirement for the Builder to even begin.",

      "text": "I definitely relate to this. Except that while I was in the 1% in university who thought hard, I don&#x27;t think my success rate was that high. My confidence in the time was quite high, though, and I still remember the notable successes.<p>And also, I haven&#x27;t started using AI for writing code yet. I&#x27;m shuffling toward that, with much trepidation. I ask it lots of coding questions. I make it teach me stuff. Which brings me to the point of my post:<p>The other day, I was looking at some Rust code and trying to work out the ownership rules. In theory, I more or less understand them. In practice, not so much. So I had Claude start quizzing me. Claude was a pretty brutal teacher -- he&#x27;d ask 4 or 5 questions, most of them solvable from what I knew already, and then 1 or 2 that introduced a new concept that I hadn&#x27;t seen. I would get that one wrong and ask for another quiz. Same thing: 4 or 5 questions, using what I knew plus the thing just introduced, plus 1 or 2 with a new wrinkle.<p>I don&#x27;t think I got 100% on any of the quizzes. Maybe the last one; I should dig up that chat and see. But I learned a ton, and had to think really hard.<p>Somehow, I doubt this technique will be popular. But my experience with it was very good. I recommend it. (It does make me a little nervous that whenever I work with Claude on things that I&#x27;m more familiar with, he&#x27;s always a little off base on some part of it. Since this was stuff I didn&#x27;t know, he could have been feeding me slop. But I don&#x27;t think so; the explanations made sense and the the compiler agreed, so it&#x27;d be tough to get anything completely wrong. And I was thinking through all of it; usually the bullshit slips in stealthily in the parts that don&#x27;t <i>seem</i> to matter, but I had to work through everything.)",

The OP even described his mentality as that of a &quot;Thinker&quot; where he received a problem during his schooling, mulled over it for a long time, and eventually came to the answer. That&#x27;s it, next problem to crack. Their whole lives revolve around this process and most have never considered anything outside it.<p>Even now, despite my own healthy skepticism of and distaste for AI, I am forced to respect that AI can do some things very fast. People like the OP, used to chiseling away at a problem for days, weeks, months, etc., now have that throughput time slashed. They&#x27;re used to the notion of thinking long and hard about a very specific problem and finally having some output; now, code modules that are &quot;good enough&quot; can be cooked up in a few minutes, and if the module works the problem is solved and they need to find the next problem.<p>I think this is more common than most people want to admit, going back to grumblings of &quot;gluing libraries together&quot; being unsatisfying. The only suggestion I have for the OP is to expand what you think about. There are other comments in this thread supporting it but I think a sea change that AI is starting to bring for software folks is that we get to put more time towards enhancing module design, user experience, resolving tech debt, and so on. People being the ones writing code is still very important.<p>I think there&#x27;s more to talk about where I do share the OP&#x27;s yearning and fears (i.e., people who weren&#x27;t voracious readers or English&#x2F;literary majors being oneshot by the devil that is AI summaries, AI-assisted reading, etc.) but that&#x27;s another story for another time.",

If he enjoyed producing lumber, then what he sees on those screens will fill him with joy. He&#x27;s producing lots of lumber. He&#x27;s much more efficient than with both axe and chainsaw.<p>But if he enjoyed being in the forest, and _doesn&#x27;t really care about lumber at all_ (Because it turns out, he never used or liked lumber, he merely produced it for his employer) then these screens won&#x27;t give him any joy at all.<p>That&#x27;s how I feel. I don&#x27;t care about code, but I also don&#x27;t really care about products. I mostly care about the craft. It&#x27;s like solving sudokus. I don&#x27;t collect solved sudokus. Once solved I don&#x27;t care about them. Having a robot solve sudokus for me would be completely pointless.<p>&gt; I sense a pattern that many developers care more about doing what they want instead of providing value to others.<p>And you&#x27;d be 100% right. I do this work because my employer provides me with enough sudokus. And I provide value back which is more than I&#x27;m compensated with. That is: I&#x27;m compensated with two things: intellectual challenge, and money. That&#x27;s the relationship I have with my employer. If I could produce 10x more but I don&#x27;t get the intellectual challenge? The employer isn&#x27;t giving me what I want - and I&#x27;d stop doing the work.<p>I think &quot;You do what the employer wants, produce what needs to be produced, and in return you get money&quot; is a simplification that misses the literal forest for all the forestry.",

Deep thinking is something everyone has it within and it varies how fast you can think. But we all got it with right environment and time we all got it in us. But thats long time ago. Now I always off load some thinking to AI. it comes up with options and you just have to steer it. By time it is getting better. Just ask it you know.

      "text": "As someone who&#x27;s been coding for several decades now (i.e. I&#x27;m old), I find the current generation of AI tools very ... freeing.<p>As an industry, we&#x27;ve been preaching the benefits of running lots of small experiments to see what works vs what doesn&#x27;t, try out different approaches to implementing features, and so on. Pre-AI, lots of these ideas never got implemented because they&#x27;d take too much time for no definitive benefit.<p>You might spend hours thinking up cool&#x2F;interesting ideas, but not have the time available to try them out.<p>Now, I can quickly kick off a coding agent to try out any hare-brained ideas I might come up with. The cost of doing so is very low (in terms of time and $$$), so I get to try out far more and weirder approaches than before when the costs were higher. If those ideas don&#x27;t play out, fine, but I have a good enough success rate with left-field ideas to make it far more justifiable than before.<p>Also, it makes playing around with one-person projects a lot practical. Like most people with partner &amp; kids, my down time is pretty precious, and tends to come in small chunks that are largely unplannable. For example, last night I spent 10 minutes waiting in a drive-through queue - that gave me about 8 minutes to kick off the next chunk of my one-person project development via my phone, review the results, then kick off the next chunk of development. Absolutely useful to me personally, whereas last year I would&#x27;ve simply sat there annoyed waiting to be serviced.<p>I know some people have an &quot;outsourcing Lego&quot; type mentality when it comes to AI coding - it&#x27;s like buying a cool Lego kit, then watching someone else assemble it for you, removing 99% of the enjoyment in the process. I get that, but I prefer to think of it in terms of being able to achieve orders of magnitude more in the time I have available, at close to zero extra cost.",

I stayed up all night mentally working on a topology question about turning a 2-torus inside out. I already knew you can&#x27;t flip a torus inside out in ordinary R^3 without self-intersection. So I kept moving and stretching the torus and the surrounding space in my head, trying to understand where the obstruction actually lived.<p>Sometime around sunrise, it clicked that if you allow the move to go through infinity(so effectively S^3), the inside&#x2F;outside distinction I was relying on just collapses, and the obstruction I was visualizing dissolves. Birds were chirping, I hadn&#x27;t slept, and nothing useful came out of it, but my internal model of space felt permanently upgraded. That&#x27;s clearly &quot;thinking hard&quot; in the sense.<p>But there&#x27;s another mode I&#x27;ve experienced that feels related but different. With a tough Code Golf problem, I might carry it around for a week. I&#x27;m not actively grinding on it the whole time, but the problem stays loaded in the background. Then suddenly, in the shower or on a walk, a compression trick or a different representation just clicks.<p>That doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;hard&quot; moment to moment. It&#x27;s more like keeping a problem resident in memory long enough for the right structure to surface.<p>One is concentrated and exhausting, the other is diffuse and slow-burning. They&#x27;re different phenomenologically, but both feel like forms of deep engagement that are easy to crowd out.",

The problem isn&#x27;t the tools, it&#x27;s the defaults.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to actually think hard about something is to write about it, or to test yourself on it. Not re-read it. Not highlight it. Generate questions from the material and try to answer them from memory.<p>The research on active recall vs passive review is pretty clear: retrieval practice produces dramatically better long-term retention than re-reading. Karpicke &amp; Blunt (2011) showed that practice testing outperformed even elaborative concept mapping.<p>So the question isn&#x27;t whether AI summarizers are good or bad -- it&#x27;s whether you use them as a crutch to avoid thinking, or as a tool to compress the boring parts so you can spend more time on the genuinely hard thinking.",

I don&#x27;t have a solution either, but I came up with a guideline on when and how to use AI that has helped me to still enjoy learning.

It also struggles with straightforward, but technically intricate things, where you have to max out your understanding of the problem.<p>Just a few days ago, I let it do something that I <i>thought</i> was straightforward, but it kept inserting bugs, and after a few hours of interaction it said itself it was running in circles. It took me a day to figure out what the problem was: an invariant I had given it was actually too strong, and needed to be weakened for a special case. If I had done all of it myself, I would have been faster, and discovered this quicker.<p>For a different task in the same project I used it to achieve a working version of something in a few days that would have taken me at least a week or two to achieve on my own. The result is not efficient enough for the long term, but for now it is good enough to proceed with other things. On the other hand, with just one (painful) week more, I would have coded a proper solution myself.<p>What I am looking forward to is being able to converse with the AI in terms of a hard logic. That will take care of the straightforward but technically intricate stuff that it cannot do yet properly, and it will also allow the AI to surface much quicker where a &quot;jump of insight&quot; is needed.<p>I am not sure what all of this means for us needing to think hard. Certainly thinking hard will be necessary for quite a while.

They are certainly not &quot;10x,&quot; but they definitely deliver more code. However, I do not observe a substantial difference in the end-to-end delivery of production-ready software. This might be on me and my lack of capacity to exploit the tools to their full extent. But, iterating over customer requirements, CI&#x2F;CD, peer reviews, and business validation takes time (and time from the most experienced people, not from the AI).<p>On the other hand, soemtimes I observe a genuine degradation of thinking among some senior engineers (there aren’t many juniors around, by the way). Meetings, requirements, documents, or technology choices seem to be directly copy&#x2F;pasted from an LLM, without a grain of original thinking, many times without insight.<p>The AI tools are great though. They give you an answer to the question. But, many times making the correct question, and knowing when the answer is not correct is the main issue.<p>I wonder if the productivity boost that senior engineers actually need is to profit from the accumulated knowledge found in books. I know it is an old technology and it is not fashionable, but I believe it is mostly unexploited if you consider the whole population of engineers :D",

It&#x27;s called getting older. Happens to us all.<p>I&#x27;m not immune to that and I catch myself sometimes being more reluctant to adapt. I&#x27;m well aware and I actively try to force myself to adapt. Because the alternative is becoming stuck in my ways and increasingly less relevant. There are a lot of much younger people around me that still have most of their careers ahead of them. They can try to whine about AI all they want for the next four decades or so but I don&#x27;t think it will help them. Or they can try to deal with the fact that these tools are here now and that they need to learn to adapt to them whether they like it or not. And we are probably going to see quite some progress on the tool front. It&#x27;s only been 3 years since ChatGPT had its public launch.<p>To address the core issue here. You can use AI or let AI use you. The difference here is about who is in control and who is setting the goals. The traditional software development team is essentially managers prompting programmers to do stuff. And now we have programmers prompting AIs to do that stuff. If you are just a middle man relaying prompts from managers to the AI, you are not adding a lot of value. That&#x27;s frustrating. It should be because it means apparently you are very replaceable.<p>But you can turn that around. What makes that manager the best person to be prompting you? What&#x27;s stopping them from skipping that entirely? Because that&#x27;s your added value. Whatever you are good at and they are not is what you should be doing most of your time. The AI tools are just a means to an end to free up more time for whatever that is. Adapting means figuring that out for yourself and figuring out things that you enjoy doing that are still valuable to do.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of work to be done. And AI tools won&#x27;t lift a finger to do it until somebody starts telling them what needs doing. I see a lot of work around me that isn&#x27;t getting done. A lot of people are blind to those opportunities. Hint: most of that stuff still looks like hard work. If some jerk can one shot prompt it, it isn&#x27;t all that valuable and not worth your time.<p>Hard work usually involves thinking hard, skilling up, and figuring things out. The type of stuff the author is complaining he misses doing.",

      "text": "I am one of those junior software developers who always struggled with starting their own projects. Long story short, I realized that my struggle stems from my lack of training in open-ended problems, where there are many ways to go about solving something, and while some ways are better than others, there&#x27;s no clear cut answer because the tradeoffs may not be relevant with the end goal.<p>I realized that when a friend of mine gave me Factorio as a gift last Christmas, and I found myself facing the exact same resistance I&#x27;m facing while <i>thinking</i> about working on my personal projects. To be more specific, it&#x27;s a fear and urge of closing the game and leaving it &quot;for later&quot; the moment I discover that I&#x27;ve either done something wrong or that new requirements have been added that will force me to change the way my factories connect with each other (or even their placement). Example: Tutorial 4 has the players introduced to research and labs, and this feeling appears when I realize that green science requires me to introduce all sorts of spaghetti just to create the mats needed for green science!<p>So I&#x27;ve done what any AI user would do and opted to use chatGPT to push through the parts where things are either overwhelming, uncertain, too open-ended, or everything in between. The result works, because the LLM has been trained to Factorio guides, and goes as far as suggesting layouts to save myself some headache!<p>Awesome, no? Except all I&#x27;ve done is outsource the decision of how to go about &quot;the thing&quot; to someone else. And while true, I could&#x27;ve done this even before LLM&#x27;s by simply watching a youtube video guide, the LLM help doesn&#x27;t stop there: It can alleviate my indecisiveness and frustration with dealing with open-ended problems for personal projects, can recommend me project structure, can generate a bullet pointed lists to pretend that I work for a company where someone else creates the spec and I just follow it step by step like a good junior software engineer would do.<p>And yet all I did just postponed the inevitable exercise of a very useful mental habit: To navigate uncertainty, pause and reflect, plan, evaluate a trade-off or 2 here and there. And while there are other places and situations where I can exercise that behavior, the fact remains that my specific use of LLM removed that weight off my shoulders. I became objectively someone who builds his project ideas and makes progress in his Factorio playthrough, but the trade-off is I remain the same person who will duck and run the moment resistance happens, and succumb to the urge of either pushing &quot;the thing&quot; for tomorrow or ask chatGPT for help.<p>I cannot imagine how someone would claim that removing an exercise from my daily gym visit will not result in weaker muscles. There are so many hidden assumptions in such statements, and an excessive focus of results in &quot;the new era where you should start now or be left behind&quot; where nobody&#x27;s thinking how this affects the person and how they ultimately function in their daily lives across multiple contexts. It&#x27;s all about output, output, output.<p>How far are we from the day where people will say &quot;well, you certainly don&#x27;t need to plan a project, a factory layout, or even decide, just have chatGPT summarize the trade-offs, read the bullet points, and choose&quot;. We&#x27;re off-loading portion of the research AND portion of the execution, thinking we&#x27;ll surely be activating the neurosynapses in our brains that retains habits, just like someone who lifts 50% lighter weights at the gym will expect to maintain muscle mass or burn fat.",

I’ve been trying to build an IoT product but I’ve been wayyyy over my head because I knew maybe 5% of what I needed to be successful. So I would get stuck many, many times, for days or weeks at a time.<p>I will say though that AI has made the difference in the last few times I got stuck. But I do get more enjoyment out of Building than Thinking, so I embrace it.",
